## Measurement recipes — a WASM rebuild is ONE shared artifact, NOT per-opt

Many entries below say "needs a WASM build / ~34-min integrator gate to flipflop."
That reads as a build *per optimization* — it is not. `build.mjs` compiles the
**entire** integrated `libjxl-012` + `bridge.cpp` into the 6 `dist` modules in **one**
run; every facade-level test/flipflop loads that same `dist`. Merge the opts, build
**once**, measure all of them. Worked examples drawn from the entries in this doc:

**1. Native A/B — NO build at all (where most kernel opts belong).**
Any opt with an isolated `*_ab.cc` harness compiles straight with clang and times
OLD vs NEW in-process — no libjxl build, no WASM, seconds to run:
```
clang++ -O3 -std=c++17 tools/enc_bit_writer_append_ab.cc -o bw_ab && ./bw_ab
clang++ -O3 -std=c++17 tools/dc_ctxmap_ab.cc -o dc_ab && ./dc_ab
```
Right tool for enc_bit_writer, enc_cluster, dc_ctxmap, ac_strategy, enc_xyb, conv5 —
a kernel-level number without touching the build.

**2. Real dec-path number — ONE shared rebuild; baseline is already in git (no 2nd build).**
For dec opts that DO fire in the app (CfL X-zero dequant, compressed_dc X-zero): do
not build per-opt. Merge the dec opts, run the single `build.mjs` rebuild, then
flipflop the new `dist` against the pre-integration `dist` **already in git history**
(built from 10783f7e at `b4a55047`) — the baseline needs no rebuild:
```
git show b4a55047:packages/jxl-wasm/dist/jxl-core.dec.simd.wasm > /tmp/old.dec.simd.wasm
git show b4a55047:packages/jxl-wasm/dist/jxl-core.dec.simd.js   > /tmp/old.dec.simd.js
# NEW = current dist (rebuilt from integrated main); flipflop OLD vs NEW via facade/section bench.
```
That one build covers every merged dec opt together — the 34-min cost is shared, paid once.

**3. Encoder number — one native cjxl A/B build pair (not WASM, not per-test).**
For enc opts (enc_cluster, enc_bit_writer SHA + timing): build cjxl OLD vs NEW once
via `jxl_encdec_ab` (`LIBJXL_SOURCE_DIR`), SHA-compare e3+e9 (byte-exact gate) and read
the timing delta. One build pair, shared across all merged enc opts.

**4. Don't build at all — no-evidence / negligible / correctness.**
- `quantizer-inl AdjustQuantBias` reschedule: compiler already reorders independent ops
  at -O2/-O3; building to chase a source-level guess is negative-EV. Gate is a per-target
  **assembly diff**, not a flipflop.
- `ans_common CreateFlatHistogram`: off every hot path; no measurement justifies the branch.
- `quantizer` lower-bound clamps: a **correctness/reachability** question, not a perf A/B —
  not byte-exact, so it cannot ride a flipflop branch at all.

**App-path-dead caveat:** some opts never run in the RAW→sRGB app path (enc_xyb fires only
linear / non-sRGB-CMS; CfL `RatioJPEG` only on JPEG-recon; compressed_dc #6 only when
subsampled). A facade flipflop reads **neutral** for these no matter how often you rebuild —
measure them native-isolated (recipe 1) or accept "provably-less-work, unmeasured."

**Next:** Prioritize A2–A6 user decisions. Then measure C1, C4–C10 on real files.

---

## WORKSTREAM 2: Cross-Package Protocol & Contract Wiring

**Next:** Verify A4/A5 status (MEMORY.md says partly done). Then wire A1–A3. Then test D2–D6.

---

## WORKSTREAM 3: Scheduler & Worker Lifecycle

**Gate:** Verifier arbitration or trace evidence  
**Effort:** 8–12h

|-------|------|--------|----------|
| B1 | MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES_GUARD conservative | 1h | Info (policy doc) |
| B2 | output_bytes vs copied_bytes unification | 1h | Clarity |
| B4 | Missing unit tests (cancel/budget/drain) | 3h | Medium (coverage) |

**Next:** Decide A2 (waiter cap policy) and A5 (overflow semantics). Then implement B1–B4.

---

## WORKSTREAM 4: WASM FFI/ABI Layer

**Priority:** MEDIUM–HIGH (security + ABI correctness)  
**Gate:** WASM rebuild cycle (Docker/Emscripten, not available locally)  
**Effort:** 8–15h + rebuild time

### Facade.ts ABI Bugs (Deferred — requires rebuild + test)

| Issue | File | Severity | Lines | Status |
|-------|------|----------|-------|--------|
| B1 | encode_rgba8_with_metadata arg-shift | HIGH | +2 args | Unimplemented; rebuild + round-trip ICC/EXIF |

| Issue | File | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| F1 | JPEG marker walk | ✅ IMPLEMENTED (b5249622) |

**Next:** Schedule WASM rebuild cycle. Coordinate B1–B6 (facade) + C1–C8 (bridge) + security audit.

---

## WORKSTREAM 5: Progressive Encode Architecture

**Priority:** LOW (Flagship ADR rejected; stay 3-pass or incremental)  
**Gate:** User pivot decision  
**Effort:** 5–15h (depends on path chosen)

### Flagship ADR Path (REJECTED)

**Status:** ❌ One-pass progressive encode quality gate FAILED (DC/AC tiers undecodable).

**Alternative paths:**
1. **Incremental** (Option 1): Keep thumb+preview tiers; add progressive_dc+group_order to full tier only (CPU-neutral, graceful big-image).
2. **Status quo** (Option 2): Stay 3-pass; close ADR as not-viable.
3. **Investigate** (Option 3): Why does prefix-decode fail? May be libjxl limitation.

**Recommendation:** Choose Option 1 or 2. Do not pursue one-pass-for-all-tiers.

### Cross-File Issues (if Option 1 chosen)

| Issue | Item | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| B1 | byteStart dead field | 0 (wait for format revision) |
| B2 | Manifest double-fetch race | 1h (share in-flight promise) |
| B3 | DC byteEnd exceeds file size | 0.5h (cap to fullFileSize - 1) |

### Performance (optional, low priority)

| Issue | Item | Expected | Gate |
|-------|------|----------|------|
| C1 | tick() dirty-flag (scheduler re-sort) | 73% sort, ~5–10% overall | Measure @ 200+ jobs |
| C3 | tee() buffering | Tier-size dependent | Measure P95 tier size |

**Next:** User decides Option 1/2/3. If Option 1, coordinate with encode-handler + manifest changes.

---

## WORKSTREAM 6: Additional Deferrals (Low Priority, Vision)

### Vision ADRs (Aspirational, backlog)

| Issue | Item | Files | Effort |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| E1 | ManifestTier LOD metadata | manifest.ts | 2h |
| E2 | TierFetchOptions timeoutMs | scheduler | 1h |
| E3 | Typed perceptual passthrough | manifest schema | 2h (pending Perceptual Constancy) |
| E4 | onManifest ML-dispatch + render-budget | scheduler + types | 3h |
| E5 | Per-frame byte offsets | progressive-manifest | 2h |

### Verifier-Uncertain (Low severity)

| Issue | Item | Impact | Status |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| H1 | take_flushed lifetime (bridge.cpp) | Low (decoder-side) | Comment-only; audit callers |
| H2 | Decoder cancel leak | Low (only if abandoned) | Code audit required |

---

## Effort Rollup (Deferred Only, Excluding Falsified)

| Workstream | Est. Effort | Gate |
|------------|-------------|------|
| 1: Raw-pipeline colour + perf | 20–30h | User validation + flipflop |
| 2: Cross-package protocol wiring | 8–12h | Cross-file coordination |
| 3: Scheduler lifecycle + tests | 8–12h | Verifier arbitration or trace |
| 4: WASM rebuild cycle | 8–15h | Docker/Emscripten build |
| 5: Progressive encode (if Option 1) | 5–10h | User decision |
| 6: Vision ADRs (backlog) | 10h | Aspirational, low priority |
| **TOTAL** | **60–90h** | **User + measurement gates** |

---

## Critical Path (Next 7–14 Days)

**Phase 1 (Today):** Consolidate output files (✅ done). User pivot decision on Flagship ADR → Option 1/2/3.

**Phase 2 (1–2 days):** Verify A4/A5 status (MEMORY.md). Decide A2 (waiter cap), A5 (overflow), B1 (MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES).

**Phase 3 (3–5 days):** Measurement + real-file validation (raw-pipeline colour C1, downscale C4–C10, scheduler C1).

**Phase 4 (5–10 days):** WASM rebuild + bridge.cpp security audit + B1–B6 facade fixes.

**Phase 5 (10–14 days):** Cross-package wiring (A1–A3, D2–D6 tests).

## ac_strategy / ac_context deferred items (2026-06-29)

From the ChatGPT "holographic" pass on the 3rd-hottest file. Landed wins are on branch `capebio/perf/ac-strategy-coefforder-zdc1-jun29-x7q2` (C1 order-traversal + Set split; C2 ZeroDensityContext1). Items below are deferred — each is either a broad cross-file refactor, profile-led, or needs a measured WASM A/B before it can be judged. None are byte-exact-trivial.

1. **Unified `StrategyGeometry` descriptor** (replace the 3 per-strategy LUTs `covered_blocks_x/y` + `log2_covered_blocks` in ac_strategy.h with one struct, + raw-byte `AcStrategyRow` accessors). Marginal (the 3 LUTs are tiny constexpr, likely register-resident when inlined); wide blast radius (enc_group/dec_group/enc_ac_strategy/etc. all derive geometry). CLAUDE.md "no opportunistic refactors". Needs an end-to-end measurement showing the repeated derivation is actually visible before touching every caller.

2. **Paired order+LUT generation + canonical (cx,cy) order cache.** The 27 raw strategies collapse to 12 canonical coeff geometries; where both forward order AND inverse LUT are needed (enc_coeff_order.cc), one traversal could emit both, and orders could be cached by normalized geometry rather than raw strategy. Setup-cost only; only a win where both are consumed together (doubles write bandwidth otherwise). Measure before landing.

3. **QF-bucket precompute** for threshold-rich frames (split `BlockCtxMap::Context` qf-threshold scan into a precomputed per-block bucket plane). Keep the direct scan when `qf_thresholds.size() <= 1` (the common case). Profile-led — only helps multi-threshold frames; the default ctx map has 0 thresholds.

4. **Default `BlockCtxMap` alloc avoidance** (use `kDefaultCtxMap` static directly until a custom map is parsed; num_ctxs=15/num_dc_ctxs=1 are invariant). Cold-start latency only, not hot-loop. Needs move-ctor rebind of the data pointer. Marginal.

5. **Header zero-density table dedup** (`extern` decl + single .cc definition for `kCoeffFreqContext`/`kCoeffNumNonzeroContext`). WASM .data size only; measure object/.wasm sections for actual duplication first. Do NOT convert to arithmetic.

6. **`CountBlocksByType` bulk single-pass count.** Only worth it if a call-site audit finds repeated `CountBlocks` scans over the same image; otherwise sequential scan is fine.

7. **Packed 1-byte `AcStrategy`** (store raw byte, derive type/is_first). Profile-led; inlined call sites likely scalar-replace the current object already, so probably no gain and adds mask/extend ops.

8. **Forensic audit: `kZeroDensityContextCount` (458) vs `kZeroDensityContextLimit` (474).** Not an optimization — verify entropy-context allocation reserves the right bound and no malformed-stream path can index 458..473. Belongs once-per-block / in allocation policy, never as a per-coefficient clamp.

9. **nzero rect-fill / strategy-map rect-fill via std::fill_n/memset with a size threshold** (dec_group nzero propagation + the new SetUnchecked). Minor; bulk fill helps only large footprints, scalar stores win for 1x1/2x2. Optional micro-tune.

---

## 2026-06-29 — enc_entropy_coder.cc: deferred cross-file / architectural levers (ChatGPT pass)

Context: round-2 micro-opt pass on `lib/jxl/enc_entropy_coder.cc` (5th-hottest file).
Implemented byte-exact in-file (branch `perf/enc-entropy-count-decomp-jun29-z4x`,
submodule capebio): count-decomposition for both nzero counters. The following
larger ideas were surfaced but DEFERRED — each crosses file boundaries and/or
needs ratio/timing evidence before landing:

- **D1 — quantizer-produced exact nonzero counts.** Have the final quantization
  stage emit one exact AC-nonzero count per (channel, transform) into a compact
  side stream; tokenization then skips its leading SIMD count pass entirely.
  Biggest potential win (deletes a whole coefficient read for large transforms)
  but cross-file (enc_quant / enc_group plumbing) and must count only *after*
  the last stage that can alter coefficients. Needs an A/B build to size it.
- **D2 — entropy-scan-order coefficient staging.** Producer writes coefficients
  already in scan order so the token loop reads `block[k]` contiguously instead
  of `block[order[k]]` (permutation gather). Removes the order-table load and
  scattered loads, best for large transforms / WASM. Large upstream disturbance
  (may regress the quantizer's contiguous writes) — measure before committing.
- **D3 — persistent token-buffer high-water reserve.** Current per-group
  `output->reserve(worst_case)` over-commits for sparse groups and pins a large
  per-worker capacity. Replace with a `TokenizeScratch` carrying a rolling
  high-water hint (EncCache-level, cross-file). NOT byte-exact-affecting; needs
  telemetry (requested vs final size, realloc count, peak RSS, first-group ms)
  before tuning. Do NOT swap to `resize()+data()` raw writes — that value-inits
  the whole pessimistic buffer (worse for sparse).

## enc_convolve_separable5.cc (2026-06-29, after border-dedup landed on perf/conv5-border-dedup-jun29-bd7)

The big win (vertical-band rolling ring, +31-49%) is already in trunk. Border-row
horizontal dedup is now done (byte-exact, helps small/short planes; neutral on
full frames). Remaining ideas, all DEFERRED with reasons:

- **N / N+1 SIMD-width cliff.** Widths exactly `Lanes` or `Lanes+1` fall to the
  scalar `SlowSeparable5` (the fast path needs `xsize >= Lanes + kRadius`). A
  dedicated one-vector kernel (load center, mirror both sides via Neighbors +
  MirrorLanes, scalar-finish the +1 column) would cover them on SIMD. DEFERRED:
  niche (only two exact widths per target); needs its own HWY_SCALAR guard and a
  correctness pass against SlowSeparable5. Real-benefit unknown without width
  telemetry from butteraugli/detect_dots.
- **x-tiling for short-wide geometry.** The pool splits work by y-band only; a
  few-rows-tall, very-wide plane yields too few band-tasks to fill cores. Add x
  tiles ONLY for short/wide (keep y-band default). Constraints: internal tile
  boundaries use ordinary HorzConvolve, only the global left/right edges mirror,
  never call Separable5 on sub-Rects (horizontal borders are rect-bound).
  DEFERRED: profiling-gated; needs evidence such planes dominate any caller.
- **Status propagation from RunInteriorRows.** `RunOnPool`'s Status is asserted
  in debug then discarded; `Run()` always returns true. Latent reliability gap
  (a runner failure reports success), not perf. DEFERRED: out of optimization
  scope; thread to Run() in a separate correctness change.
- **Weight-family dispatch (identity / 3-tap / horizontal-only / vertical-only).**
  Classify `WeightsSeparable5` once at construction and skip zero taps. DEFERRED:
  data-led only — needs coefficient telemetry that those families actually reach
  this function; also changes NaN/signed-zero propagation, so not byte-exact.
- **Scalar-tail abs/Mirror hygiene.** The remainder loop recomputes `std::abs(dy/dx)`
  weight indexing and calls `Mirror` for every column incl. interior ones. Could
  hoist weights and skip Mirror until the final two columns. DEFERRED: micro
  (< Lanes columns/row), and must preserve the exact 25-term accumulation order
  to stay byte-exact — low value, easy to get subtly wrong.

## enc_convolve_separable5 — ChatGPT 3-pass analysis leftovers (2026-06-29)

Context: y-reuse ring + remainder-collapse already landed on submodule main
@10783f7e; border-row dedup landed on `perf/enc-conv5-border-dedup-jun29-r3x`.
Remaining ChatGPT suggestions, deferred:

1. **SIMD width-cliff (xsize == N or N+1).** These widths fall to `SlowSeparable5`
   though one custom vector could cover them. NOT byte-exact vs the current slow
   path (different numerical reduction tree for those widths) → needs an explicit
   tolerance/identity decision before landing. Low value (narrow rects only).
2. **x-tiling for short/wide geometry.** When `num_bands` is tiny (few-row, very
   wide rect) the y-band scheduler under-fills cores. Add x-slicing (internal
   tiles only; global edges keep mirroring; never recurse `Separable5` on sub-
   rects — horizontal borders are rect-bound). Scheduler change; butteraugli's
   roughly-square pyramids rarely hit this. Needs its own benchmark.
3. **SIMD output-rect / in-place API.** Fast path requires `SameSize(rect,*out)`
   and origin-zero output; callers needing a sub-rect must materialize+copy. A
   `Separable5ToRect` (StoreU when unaligned) or delayed-write in-place variant
   could remove a full-plane round-trip. Audit `butteraugli.cc` Blur and
   `enc_detect_dots.cc` for such temporaries first — potentially bigger than any
   inner-loop change, but a caller-contract refactor.
4. **Weight-family classification** (identity / 3-tap / h-only / v-only). Classify
   once in `WeightsSeparable5` ctor, dispatch specialized kernels. Needs
   coefficient telemetry to justify; risks NaN/signed-zero policy changes and
   per-Highway-target code bloat. Data-led only.
5. **Status propagation.** `RunInteriorRows` does `JXL_DASSERT(status); (void)`
   — a pool failure is reported as success. Thread through `Run()`. Reliability,
   not perf; tiny.

## enc_adaptive_quantization — ChatGPT 4-pass analysis leftovers (2026-06-29)

Context: This is the hottest remaining enc file. Big batch already landed on
submodule main @10783f7e (6c8dd38a): TileDistMap margin==0 fast path, FuzzyErosion
2×2 fusion, MaskingSqrt kSqrtMul precompute, AdjustQuantField 1x1-skip + mean-only-
when-covered≥4, quantizer-const hoist, MaxError any_change exit + per-block clip,
terminal-iteration Butteraugli skip. THREE more byte-exact opts landed on branch
`perf/enc-aq-fixedpoint-hfblue-jun29-q8x` (capebio, off 10783f7e): cur_pow==0
fixed-point early-exit (+13% e9 on real RAW), HF-dominates-blue short-circuit,
HfModulation dy==7 vertical no-op. Remaining ChatGPT suggestions, deferred:

### Output-changing (need ratio + Butteraugli regression, NOT byte-exact)
1. **pow(x, 1/16) → 4× std::sqrt** in TileDistMap tile_dist. Mathematically equal,
   much cheaper (esp. WASM), but NOT bit-identical → changes AQ decisions → output
   bytes. Gate behind size/Butteraugli corpus regression.
2. **std::pow(diff, cur_pow) → FastPow2f(FastLog2f·k)** in the quant-update loop.
   cur_pow is only ever 0.2 (i<2) or 0 in practice. Fast path promising on WASM;
   crosses quant-bin boundaries → corpus-validate.
3. **SIMD fast-log for mask1x1** (replace scalar std::log1p per pixel with vector
   FastLog2f). Large scalar-libm cost on the full-res 1x1 Laplacian pass. Changes
   the masking heuristic → validate on HDR/low-light/edge-heavy images.
4. **Merge the two gamma-Laplacian walks** (scalar mask1x1 + SIMD 4×4 pre-erosion
   both compute gammac·(in−neighbour_avg)). One signed-Laplacian producer feeding
   both. Scalar-vs-SIMD association differs → not byte-exact; experiment only.

### Architectural (large surface / correctness risk)
5. **Persistent AQ round-trip context (E/F — ChatGPT's "most strategic").** Reuse
   PassesDecoderState / ModularFrameEncoder / render pipeline / GroupDecCache /
   decoded ImageBundle across the 2–5 FindBestQuantization iterations instead of
   rebuilding each round; plus an AQ-narrow InitializePassesEncoder that skips
   special-frame/entropy-token/bitstream-only work (note the existing
   `special_frames.resize(num_special_frames)` rollback — generic init does work
   AQ discards). Biggest potential multi-ms win but touches decoder reset
   contracts → must prove byte-exact across corpus (stale group caches are the
   hazard). Compounds with the landed render-pipeline descriptor reuse.
6. **Strategy-cell native representation.** After AdjustQuantField every member of
   a variable AC strategy is uniform and TileDistMap broadcasts one residual back
   over the same footprint; the iterative state is really one (q, residual,
   initial) per AC-strategy root. Represent it that way (no expand→update→collapse
   per block; direct strategy residual accumulation in the comparator). Removes
   duplicated div/pow/lround/clamp. Large refactor touching the Quantizer API
   (SetQuantFieldFromStrategyCells); byte-exactness needs care.
7. **Incremental sparse round-trips.** After the first refinement only some raw
   quant cells change; re-encode/re-render only affected groups + AC/EPF/render/
   Butteraugli halo. Very high complexity (invalidation-radius correctness);
   highest payoff at Tortoise. Research-grade.
8. **Staged Gamma+HF fusion** (G, conservative form). Combine the Gamma and HF
   per-block scans (both consume X/Y) — NOT the full 3-way fuse (register
   pressure / WASM regression risk per ChatGPT's own walk-back). Keep independent
   accumulators/order for byte-exactness; benchmark native + WASM separately.

### Minor byte-exact, deferred (low value or small risk)
9. **tile_distmap buffer reuse** across iterations (refactor TileDistMap to fill an
   existing ImageF). Saves a small blocks-sized alloc per iteration (only 2–5×);
   marginal now that #1 cuts iterations.
10. **score / ScaleImage(-1) debug-gating.** Release-dead: TileDistMap raises diff
    to the 16th (even) power so the sign flip can't matter; `score` only feeds a
    debug printf. Pass nullptr + #if-guard. Tiny.
11. **High butteraugli_target (≥14) modulation bypass.** dampen==0 → result is a
    constant base_level; skip Gamma/HF/Blue entirely. Rare target; low value.
12. **ComputeTile SIMD-tail off-by-one** (`x + 1 + Lanes < x_end` → `x + Lanes <
    x_end`). Recovers one vector/row but is a bounds-sensitive change near the
    right-neighbour load — needs careful padding audit; skipped as too risky for
    one vector.
13. **mask1x1 tile-local fused blur** (fuse raw mask1x1 production with Symmetric5
    over each tile's core + 2px halo, removing the full-res intermediate + barrier).
    Seam risk at internal tile boundaries (current halos only cover the outer rect
    edge); benchmark vs the optimized full-image Symmetric5 before adopting.
14. **Max-error: accumulate max during group decode** instead of writing then
    re-reading the full decoded image. Complication: strategy regions crossing
    group boundaries (need root-index map + reduction). Max-error mode only.

### enc_convolve_separable5 — secondary items (2026-06-29)

The register rolling ring is the shipped interior optimum (x-tile scratch ring
tested and rejected, see rejected-opts CONV5-2). Remaining ChatGPT secondaries,
deferred as low-EV for the WASM 4-lane butteraugli/dots callers:

15. **Equal-axis 3-weight load** (byte-exact). `butteraugli.cc` Blur calls
    Separable5 with `horz == vert`. Detect equality once and load 3 broadcast
    weight vectors instead of 6, passing each to both stages → frees 3 vector
    registers in the hot `RingColumn`. Same Add/MulAdd order → byte-exact.
    Uncertain micro-win; the ring is not spill-bound on AVX2/WASM today (it
    already hits the +39–49% ceiling), so register relief may not show. Measure
    before adopting.
16. **Narrow capped-SIMD fallback** — AVX-512-only concern (widths 6–17 fall to
    SlowSeparable5). Irrelevant to the WASM ship target (already 4-lane; only
    sub-6px images affected). Skip unless a native AVX-512 path matters.
17. **Direct 2-D / isotropic kernel** — saves a few arithmetic ops but keeps the
    25-source-load pattern and **reorders accumulation → NOT byte-exact**. Would
    change butteraugli scores → encode bitstream; needs decode-SHA + Butteraugli
    quality gating, not the encode-SHA gate. Out of scope as a default path.

## dec_ans.{h,cc} TTFP pass — deferred (2026-06-29)

Branch `perf/dec-ans-ttfp-inline-jun29-z4k1` (capebio submodule, off main
@10783f7e) landed 3 byte-exact wins (W1 hot-path no-LZ77 inline via
`ReadHybridUintClusteredMaybeInlined`; W2 `std::move(counts)` into by-value
`InitAliasTable`; W3 ReadHistogram heap vecs → 258-stack arrays). 14/14 testable
files decode byte-exact (native static djxl OLD@10783f7e vs NEW), native ST
+2.5% median on _cap (noisy, no regression). Deferred from the same analysis:

1. **Definitive WASM/browser TTFP bench of W1.** Native ST is +2.5% but noisy and
   a weak proxy — inlining wins are WASM-codegen-dependent (cf. the "SSSE3 proxy
   lied for transpose" lesson). Real gate before merge: rebuild the dec WASM tiers
   from this branch and A/B first-paint via the browser harness (flipflopdom) on
   real RAW→JXL O1 blobs. ~34min WASM build.
2. **Split LZ77 state out of `ANSSymbolReader` (or at least drop the
   `special_distances_[120]{}` zero-init).** No-LZ77 readers currently zero-init
   ~480B + carry LZ fields. Cold-start/first-group win, but needs a profile to
   confirm reader construction shows up, and MSan/fuzz after removing the init.
3. **Bounded LZ window.** 4 MiB (`kWindowSize`) allocated per LZ reader regardless
   of how many values it can emit. Pass a proven max-emit bound from the caller →
   allocate `min(kWindowSize, max_emit)`. Needs caller plumbing; LZ-streams/cold
   start only.
4. **Virtual zero-run instead of the initial `distance==0` memset.** Up to 4 MiB
   memset before useful decode. Model as a `zero_run_` flag (incl. Save/Restore).
   Needs real-corpus frequency of first-run zero copies to justify.
5. **`IsSingleValueAndAdvance` degenerate fast-path.** Use precomputed
   `degenerate_symbols[ctx]` (add a `const int*` reader member) to skip the alias
   lookup. Byte-exact-plausible but needs careful verification that value + state
   advancement match exactly; marginal (only when that optimization path is hit).
6. **`uint16_t alphabet_sizes` overflow hardening (dec_ans.cc:204-208).** Real
   latent bug: `DecodeVarLenUint16()+1` can be 65536 → wraps to 0 in uint16_t
   BEFORE the `> max_alphabet_size` check (valid streams never reach it, so
   byte-exact). Malformed-input robustness only; deserves its own fix + fuzz, not
   a perf-pass rider.
7. **Defensive `max_num_bits = 0` reset + `degenerate_symbols.assign(n,-1)`.**
   No-op in the current flow (ANSCode is freshly constructed per DecodeHistograms,
   not reused) — only matters if ANSCode reuse is ever introduced. Harmless; skip
   until reuse exists.
8. **Per-target A/B of (a) alias-table prefetch on/off and (b) ANS normalization
   branchful vs branchless.** Both are target-sensitive (the source comment only
   claims parity "on SKX"); choose at compile time per target, never a per-symbol
   runtime heuristic. Needs WASM + native A/B.
9. **Setup micro-ops:** single `Refill()` batching in DecodeVarLenUint8/16 +
   DecodeUintConfig; table-lookup (CTZ) for the unary shift prefix (the file's own
   `TODO(veluca)`); packed-RLE rewrite of the histogram scratch (W3 already moved
   it to the stack — the further RLE-into-logcounts packing is byte-exact-risky and
   low value).

## enc_modular R1–R4 + D2 pass (2026-06-29, branch capebio/perf/enc-modular-r1to4-d2-jun29-q4z)

Landed (byte-exact, see branch): R1 two-phase single-group prepare + pool for the
Global RCT/WP search; R2 AddACMetadata zero-channel construction; R3 reserves; R4
uint32 extra-channel guard + gi_channel_ reuse-clear; D2 EstimateCost workspace
reuse across the RCT search.

Deferred from THIS pass:
1. **Subsampled `AddVarDCTDC` exact allocation (4:2:0 / 4:2:2).** The shared
   `Image::Create(...,8,3)` makes three full-res planes; the subsampled branch then
   `shrink()`s the two chroma planes (full-res backing already allocated). Allocating
   each channel at final dims needs splitting the shared create across the four
   branches. Rare path — the RAW pipeline is 4:4:4, so never exercised here. Byte-exact
   memory-only win; do it if a subsampled-input workload appears.
2. **R1 pool speedup is multi-thread-only and single-group-only.** The two-phase split
   is byte-exact and removes a real data race, but its FwdRct/do_transform parallelism
   only helps when (a) encode uses a thread pool and (b) the frame is one group (small
   images / TTFP preview blobs). The 1-thread A/B harness cannot measure it; verified
   byte-exact instead. Multi-thread single-group bench is the open measurement.
3. **D1 palette `cost_before` carry-forward and D3 bounded EstimateCost scoring**
   remain deferred (see external/libjxl-012/HANDOFF_enc_modular.md). D1 changes the
   bitstream (needs a size bench); D3 is NOT byte-exact (fractional-entropy floor is
   nonlinear, so dropping the constant non-colour channels can flip a near-tie RCT
   choice) — confirmed this pass, do not land as "byte-exact".

## compressed_dc DC-context-map (2026-06-29)

Branch `capebio/perf/dec-compressed-dc-ctxmap-jun29-q7x` @f7f5db73 (off submodule
main 0ba69efd) landed #5 (4:4:4) + #6 (subsampled) byte-exact builder
specializations. Deferred from that pass:

1. **#6 vertical chroma reuse.** Current #6 reuses each native chroma bucket only
   *within* a row (x>>HShift monotone). A native chroma row is still reclassified
   for every luma row it covers (2 rows in 4:2:0). Full 2-D reuse needs a per-row
   native-bucket scratch buffer; left out to stay allocation-free and avoid a
   per-DC-group alloc regression on small groups. Revisit only if a profile shows
   the subsampled context build is hot (it is JPEG-recompression territory; the
   RAW→XYB pipeline is 4:4:4 and never hits #6).

2. **Integrator decode-A/B gate.** Equivalence here is proven on the isolated
   builder (tools/dc_ctxmap_ab.cc, 6.66M bytes, 0 fails) + by construction. The
   full-lib gate is a decode A/B (native static djxl or WASM) on a stream that
   actually signals num_dc_ctxs>1 — RAW-app JXLs may never exercise this path, so
   pick/encode a multi-DC-context VarDCT stream to confirm before merge.

---

## enc_xyb (3rd-hottest) — 2026-06-29 (branch capebio/perf/enc-xyb-copy-elim-jun29-k3w9)

Landed this pass (byte-exact, verified native cjxl A/B): ChatGPT **1A** (fused
`LinearSRGBToXYBAndCopy`) + **1B** (out-of-place `LinearSRGBToXYBFrom`) copy
eliminations in `ToXYB`. These fire only for linear-sRGB / non-sRGB-CMS inputs at
VarDCT+kKitten — the RAW→sRGB app path never reaches them (sRGB branch untouched).

Remaining ChatGPT enc_xyb ideas NOT pursued (deferred, not rejected):

1. **ScaleXYB → Highway SIMD + dispatch.** Real SIMD hole (scalar per-pixel,
   outside HWY_NAMESPACE). Worth it only if `ScaleXYB` is hot — it runs on the
   scaled-XYB VarDCT path. Needs a flipflop/micro-harness to justify; not
   byte-exact-trivial (must preserve op order, no MulAdd). Output unchanged.
2. **No-clamp template (skip 3× ZeroIfNegative for proven-nonnegative input).**
   3 vector clamps vs 3 cube roots — tiny. Needs an importer-propagated
   "samples nonnegative" invariant that the API doesn't carry today. Low EV.
3. **Shorten OpsinAbsorbance coeff lifetimes / YCbCr unit-mul deletion (kDiffR/
   kDiffB == 1.0).** Disassembly-gated; clang likely already folds. Low EV.
4. **Area-stripe scheduling for the 3 XYB paths** (they do one task/row; only
   RgbToYcbcr stripes). Geometric, not byte-exact-trivial; RAW images are large
   enough that per-row tasking rarely starves the pool. Needs benchmark.
5. **Direct RGB8→XYB ingest / prepared-constants cache / empty-image early-exit.**
   Architectural, belong at the import boundary, not inside enc_xyb.

Verify-harness note: the minimal static cjxl can't read PNG/JPEG pixels, so the
1B (CMS) vector needed `-DJPEGXL_ENABLE_APNG=1 -DJPEGXL_BUNDLE_LIBPNG=1` to read
an AdobeRGB-ICC PNG. A ToXYB micro-flipflop (to actually *measure* the copy-elim,
which is ~0.03% of an e9 encode and thus unmeasurable at process scope) was not
built — the win is provably-less-work and app-irrelevant. Build if a future pass
wants a number.

## CfL X-zero family — byte-exact follow-ups (deferred 2026-06-30)

Context: implemented decoder X-CfL-free dequant specialization in dec_group.cc
(branch `perf/dec-group-xzero-dequant-jun30-x4k9`, capebio, off submodule
00f4d7fc). When the X color-correlation factor is exactly 0 (XYB default for the
whole X channel), `MulAdd(0, dequant_y, dequant_x_cc) == dequant_x_cc` bit-exact,
so a `kXCfL=false` template variant drops one vector FMA per X lane. These
sibling items from the same ChatGPT CfL analysis are NOT done — clean, byte-exact,
worth a future pass:

1. **compressed_dc.cc DC X-zero specialization** — `DequantDCImpl<bool kUseXDCfL>`
   gated on `cfl_factors[0] == 0.0f`. Line 228 still unconditional
   `Store(MulAdd(in_y, cfl_fac_x, in_x), ...)`. Same byte-exact argument; smaller
   win (1 sample/8x8 block vs per-coeff) but pairs cleanly. DC path = early decode.

2. **dec_group JPEG `RatioJPEG` hoist** — JPEG-recon branch recomputes
   `ColorCorrelation::RatioJPEG(row_cmap[c][abs_tx])` per 8x8 block per channel
   (dec_group.cc ~617). Hoist to per-color-tile `jpeg_scale[3]`. Exact integer
   arithmetic, JPEG-reconstruction path only (irrelevant to RAW→JXL app workflow).

3. **chroma_from_luma.cc micro-cleanups** — transactional `DecodeDC` (parse into
   locals → validate both bases → commit once + single `RecomputeDCFactors`,
   currently `SetColorFactor` recomputes early then again at end); `GetColorFactor()`
   return `uint32_t` not `float` (stored type is already uint32_t). Header-decode
   micro, not ms-level.

WASM decode A/B (StandardMultifileTest / section bench, ~34min build) is the
integrator gate for the X-zero magnitude — native AVX2 harness only shows
direction (one FMA; WASM drops mul+add, no native FMA → larger win expected).

---

## ans_common.cc / .h — CreateFlatHistogram write-count tweak (2026-06-30)

**Deferred, not implemented.** ChatGPT pass proposed making `CreateFlatHistogram`
(ans_common.h) write `min(rem, len-rem)` adjusted entries instead of always `rem`
(start from `count+1` and decrement the suffix when the remainder is the larger
half). Byte-identical output, verified by inspection.

**Why deferred:** truly negligible — the function builds a tiny vector and is not
on any hot path; the change adds a branch + a second construction path for a
saving of at most len/2 integer increments. Fails the surgical/simplicity bar for
the marginal gain. Revisit only if a profile ever flags flat-histogram setup.

The real ans_common win (allocation-free `InitAliasTable`, 3.61x faster table
build, byte-exact) landed on submodule branch
`capebio/perf/ans-common-allocfree-jun30-z7k` (PUSHED, not merged). The three
ChatGPT "bug"/Lookup claims were debunked — see docs/1 rejected optimizations.md
(ANS-R1..R3).

---

## enc_cluster: merged-population-cost cache (2026-06-30)

Branch `capebio/perf/enc-cluster-fuse-reindex-jun30-v8n3` (PUSHED, not merged).

**Deferred (benchmark-gated, NOT landed):** In the kBest merge loop, a valid
`HistogramPair` already paid for the exact merged `ANSPopulationCost()`. When
that pair is accepted, the loop recomputes the same cost after `AddHistogram`.
Caching it in the heap entry would save one `ANSPopulationCost()` per accepted
merge — but it widens every `HistogramPair` from 16 to >=20 bytes, hurting
priority-queue cache density for ALL queued (mostly rejected) negative pairs.
Net effect is data-dependent (merge acceptance rate vs queue depth) and must be
measured on a real encoder corpus at e9 before landing. Not byte-affecting
(pure caching), so low risk — purely a perf trade-off.

**Also deferred — full timing gate:** the landed changes are byte-exact and
each is a strict work/alloc reduction (fused traversal, no deep-copy reindex,
O(α) union-find vs O(N) scan, no per-block branch in distance/KL). Per the
"byte-exact + theoretically better => choose new" rule they were taken without
a flip-flop, since the timing harness requires a full libjxl-012 encoder build
(native cjxl or WASM enc). Integrator gate: native/WASM enc A/B at e9 (kBest)
for end-to-end byte-identical output + a timing delta.

---

## 2026-06-30 — quantizer-inl.h AdjustQuantBias SIMD reschedule (needs assembly + bench)

**Deferred, not implemented.** Proposed reordering of `AdjustQuantBias`
(`quantizer-inl.h`): compute `ApproximateReciprocal(quant)` and the
`Set(df, biases[c])` / `Set(df, biases[3])` broadcasts up front so sign/mask work
overlaps reciprocal latency. Byte-exact (pure independent-op reorder, identical ops
and approximation).

**Why deferred:** no evidence it is a win. The ops are already independent and the
compiler scheduler reorders them at -O2/-O3; hoisting the reciprocal lengthens its
live range and may cost a register/spill. This helper is hot (dec_group + enc_group
AC dequant, instantiated SSE2/SSE4/AVX2 + WASM). Decision needs per-target generated
assembly inspection and a flipflop/A-B across the target matrix — not a source-level
guess. Revisit only with that evidence.

## 2026-06-30 — Quantizer lower-bound clamps (correctness question, not perf)

**Deferred as a correctness question.** A pass proposed `std::max(1, lround(...))` in
`ScaleGlobalScale` and `std::max(1.0f, fval)` in `ComputeGlobalScaleAndQuant`,
guarding against `global_scale`/`quant_dc` rounding to 0 (→ `inv_quant_dc_ = inf`).
Upstream has no such guard. Excluded from the byte-exact branch because it changes
output. **Open question for the maintainers:** is the zero/near-zero path actually
reachable from any encoder configuration? If yes, this is a real robustness fix worth
landing as an explicit (non-byte-exact) change; if no, leave upstream as-is. Needs a
reachability analysis over the quant_dc / global_scale derivation, not a blind clamp.

## 2026-06-30 — enc_bit_writer append pass: integrator verification gate (deferred)

Branch `perf/enc-bit-writer-append-jun30-w8k4` (capebio, off submodule main `00f4d7fc`)
is byte-exact-verified by a standalone A/B harness (192 cases, 0 mismatches) and
real `-fsyntax-only` compiles of `enc_bit_writer.cc` + 7 caller TUs, but two checks
need the integrator's full toolchain and are deferred:

1. **Full `enc_bit_writer_test` execution.** gtest source is absent from the worktree's
   `third_party`, so the extended `AppendUnaligned` gtest (all 8 dst offsets, multi-block
   + partial-bit sources, back-to-back appends, zero-tail trailing write) was logic-proven
   via the standalone harness but not run under gtest. Run `ninja enc_bit_writer_test`.
2. **WASM enc A/B byte-exact.** The templated `WithMaxBits` (was `std::function`) is
   codegen-dependent; confirm OLD-vs-NEW encoder output is SHA/size identical on a real
   RAW→JXL stream (e3 + e9). Theory says byte-exact (only call binding changed, no bit
   semantics), but the workflow gates output-shape changes on decode/enc SHA, not theory.

Harness to reproduce timing: `clang++ -O3 -std=c++17 tools/enc_bit_writer_append_ab.cc -o bw_ab`.

## LJPEG micro-ops — WASM confirmation of the hot-path codegen pieces (2026-06-30)

Branch `perf/ljpeg-microops-jun30-z7k` (super only; `crates/raw-pipeline/src/ljpeg.rs`).
Byte-exact pass: fast8 `[u32;256]`→`[u16;256]`, packed `lookup` `Vec<u16>`, const-generic
`BitReader` (telemetry compiles out of `decode_tile`), oversubscribed-DHT panic→bail guard,
struct DHT cache (no probe alloc), one-entry thread-local plan cache, generic-kernel stack
array + direct `&HuffTable` + unchecked store. Already verified byte-exact: 21 ljpeg unit
tests (known-output oracles unchanged), full crate suite 157 pass, **parity EXACT on 165 real
DNG tiles** (cps=2/prec=16; fast8 resolves 99.89% of symbols).

**Native timing — non-regression, modest floor win.** `cargo run --release --no-default-features
--example ljpeg_c1_flip` on `PXL_20260527_180319603.RAW-02.ORIGINAL.dng` (165 tiles), OLD
(unmodified main) vs NEW binaries, min-of-5 (machine is contended — 7 sibling worktrees — so
**min** = contention-free floor; upper samples are pure upward noise, incl. a 401/502 ms
outlier):

| | min (floor) | median band |
|---|---|---|
| OLD | 266.4 ms | ~285–316 |
| NEW | 248.3 ms | ~297–320 |

Floor ≈ **−7%**; medians overlap inside the noise band. Honest read: the dominant cost is the
per-symbol Huffman arithmetic (unchanged); the win is the smaller hot LUT + removed telemetry
stores + 164 skipped plan re-parses, which clears the noise floor only at the min.

**Open (integrator gate):** the app decodes RAW via the **WASM** raw-pipeline, not this native
build. The fast8-u16 shrink and the const-generic telemetry removal are **codegen-dependent**
(L1 footprint / store elision differ under emscripten/clang + wasm32). Confirm the same parity
+ non-regression on a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build of `raw-pipeline` (the existing RAW→lightbox
flipflop / section bench), folded into the next shared WASM rebuild — not a per-opt build. Theory
+ native parity say byte-exact and ≥-neutral; this only re-checks the wasm codegen delta.

---

## LJPEG hot-path pass (2026-06-30) — deferred API + WASM gate

Branch `perf/ljpeg-hotpath-jun30-h4t9` (on z7k `@1c089828`): byte-exact hot-path micro-ops,
**~30% native decode floor** (min 84.2 ms vs z7k 119.8 ms; 165 real DNG tiles cps=2/prec=16;
FNV fingerprint `0x199b1481ead6ac12` identical OLD/NEW). Harness:
`examples/ljpeg_hotpath_flip.rs` (prints fingerprint + interleaved decode timing for cross-build
OLD/NEW comparison).

**Deferred — public prepared-plan execution API.** The proposal added `LjpegPlan::decode_into`
/ `decode_into_stats` + `execution_plan_check` so a caller can prepare a plan once and decode
many tiles against it. No caller exists today, and the thread-local one-entry `LAST_PLAN` cache
(z7k) already gives the same skip-the-reparse benefit transparently through `decode_tile`.
Deferred until a caller actually wants to hold an `LjpegPlan` across tiles — then expose the API
plus `execution_plan_check`.

**SWAR fill (kept, real-decode neutral).** The branchless u32 0xFF-detect clears its isolated
gate (5.4%, `ljpeg_fill_swar_flip`) but is **neutral in real decode** (fill is amortized off the
per-symbol critical chain; the 30% comes from the `real_in_buf`/guard/`extend` changes). Kept per
the example gate + rule 10; the integrator may drop commit `eee8564f` to keep `unsafe` minimal.

**Open (integrator gate):** the app decodes RAW via the **WASM** raw-pipeline, not this native
build. Branchless `extend`, the removed per-symbol masks, and the SWAR unaligned u32 load are all
**codegen-dependent** under emscripten/clang + wasm32. Confirm parity (fingerprint) +
non-regression on a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build of `raw-pipeline` (RAW→lightbox flipflop /
section bench), folded into the next shared WASM rebuild. Native says byte-exact + ~30% faster;
this only re-checks the wasm codegen delta. Same gate class as the z7k pass above.
## 2026-06-30 — tone_simd.rs deferred (from the matrix-fused-seam pass)

Branch `perf/tone-simd-matrix-seam-jun30-t9k2` landed the byte-exact seam. Two ChatGPT
proposals are plausible but not worth landing now; revisit only with a flipflop win, and
note the ceiling: the tone matvec is **~4% of the frame** (post-LUT clamp+cast+gather is
~45% — the real bottleneck, already at its measured floor). Tone-math micro-ops cannot move
the frame much.

1. **`TonePlan` enum (LumaOnly / Matrix / Active), built once per render.** Would fold mode
   classification + coefficient prep out of `apply_tone_bulk` into a small state machine that
   the kernel matches on. The seam already gives the common (Matrix) path its "prepare once"
   benefit; the enum's extra value is only the LumaOnly branch (below) and removing the
   per-call `luma_weights`/`c1`/`c2` setup from the active path (a handful of flops, once per
   block). Larger surface (touches all 3 backends + the pipeline call sites). Gate on a
   flipflop showing the active-path setup is measurable.

2. **`sat == 0` luma-only SIMD kernel** (one `lm·rgb` dot + 3 broadcast stores vs a full 3×3
   matvec). Byte-exact to the current matrix path (rows all equal `lm`), ~3× fewer flops on
   that block. Triggers only when the saturation slider is at −1.0 AND vibrance is 0 (full
   monochrome). If B&W conversion ever becomes a measured hot path, add it (probably as the
   LumaOnly arm of the TonePlan enum); until then the matrix path covers it correctly.

3. **`BLK` tile sweep (512/1024/1536/2048).** Only with `tone_matrix_prepared_flip` /
   `process_simd_flip` evidence; the 24 KiB working set is currently deliberate.
## FS-D1: frame_stats u64 exact-integer luma accumulator (native + WASM, coordinated) (2026-06-30)
## FS-D1: frame_stats u64 exact-integer luma accumulator — ✅ DONE 2026-06-30

**Shipped** on `perf/frame-stats-u64accum-jun30-m4k2` (native-only). Replaced f64+Kahan
luma_sum/luma_sq in both scalar and AVX2 with exact u64 sums (luma²≤4.23e9 ⇒ u64 exact to
~4.3 Gpx). Result: scalar **−34%..−36%** (interleaved Kahan-vs-u64 A/B), AVX2 neutral-to-
faster, scalar==avx2 bit-identical **for every input** (prior Kahan parity was incidental).
On the 5-size dump corpus (incl 24MP) the u64 output is bit-identical to the prior Kahan
output — observed drift zero; ≤1 ULP only on adversarial inputs.

**The original "deferred" premise was WRONG and is corrected here:** native and WASM were
NOT one coordinated telemetry contract. The WASM kernel (`src/lib.rs` `fs_core_scalar`)
accumulates **plain f64, no Kahan**, *by design*, to byte-match the JS
`analyzeProgressiveFrame` reference (JS numbers are f64). Native used Kahan. So the two
were already non-identical past ~6 MP — two independent contracts. Porting u64 into the
WASM kernel would BREAK the wasm↔JS byte match (JS can't do u64-exact without BigInt), so
WASM is deliberately left on f64. D1 is correctly native-only; there is no cross-target
desync to coordinate.

**Still open (separate, genuinely cross-target):** the `luma_variance` divisor. It scales
variance by `1/65025` (NOT [0,1] — peaks ~16256.25). The doc is now corrected to state the
real range. Changing the *formula* to a true [0,1] metric (÷ `65025²/4`) would touch native
+ WASM + JS together and is a deliberate telemetry-versioned change — left deferred.

## FS-D2: hash-free metrics fast path — REJECTED (dead code, no caller) 2026-06-30

## FS-D2: hash-free metrics fast path (2026-06-30)

The 8-lane FNV hash is a serial recurrence across blocks (each block depends on the
prior) — it is the kernel's real throughput ceiling, not cache locality. Change-detection
needs the hash; exposure/contrast triage (`mean_luma`, `luma_variance`) does not. A
separate metrics-only entry (no hash, no `vpmulld` dependency chain) would let those
callers run faster. Worth it only as a deliberate API split with a real caller that wants
metrics without the change-id — not a runtime flag inside the hot loop.
## jxl_casaencoder.rs — deferred structural levers (2026-06-30)

Context: final optimization pass on the encoder wrapper. The landed change
(`perf/casaencoder-hint-norm-k9x`) is allocation-only and byte-exact. The wrapper
is now well-shaped; its remaining *real* cost is the libjxl-internal copy of every
submitted plane, which no Rust-side micro-op can remove. The items below are the
genuine large levers — all are **features needing new `jxl-ffi` bindings** and/or
behavioral changes, so they are out of scope for a surgical byte-exact pass and are
deferred to the integrator/owner with explicit cost notes.

1. **Chunked / streaming zero-copy input (highest peak-memory lever).**
   `JxlEncoderAddImageFrame` and `JxlEncoderSetExtraChannelBuffer` both **copy**
   their input into libjxl before any compression — a full extra memory-bandwidth
   pass over the whole RGB16/RGBA16 frame (the real RAW pipeline feeds u16). The
   only way around it is a second input path on `JxlEncoderAddChunkedFrame` +
   `JxlChunkedFrameInputSource` + `JxlEncoderSetOutputProcessor`, exposing
   callbacks that hand libjxl bounded rectangles straight from the caller's
   immutable buffers (also fixes padded-stride/tiled sources without a repack).
   **Needs:** new bindings in `jxl-ffi` (chunked input source, chunked frame,
   output processor, `FlushInput`); a separate `StreamingFrame`/`encode_to<W: Write>`
   API kept distinct from the compact in-memory `encode_into` (do not mix the two
   output modes — libjxl forbids it). Gate behind a `jxl-ffi` capability feature.
   Benchmark buffering modes 1/2 (lower peak memory, may trade density/progressive
   order). Use `AddImageFrame` for small images, chunked for large RAW frames.

2. **Explicit auto-threaded reusable encoder + resizable runner.**
   `Encoder::new` and the `encode_rgb8`/`encode_rgba8` helpers allocate no runner →
   default single-threaded. `casabio_encode.rs` already calls `with_threads` on the
   full-res path, but a `with_auto_threads` (via
   `JxlThreadParallelRunnerDefaultNumWorkerThreads`) and a resizable runner
   (`JxlResizableParallelRunner*` + `SuggestThreads(w,h)`) would right-size threads
   per frame for mixed thumbnail/full-RAW batches and let a batch scheduler cap
   `cores/active_encodes`. **Do NOT** silently auto-thread `new()` — a pipeline that
   already parallelizes image jobs externally would oversubscribe. **Needs:** runner
   bindings; behavioral (libjxl encode stays deterministic across thread counts, so
   output is unaffected). Adopt at the call site, not by changing `new()`.

3. **Native 10/12/14-bit-in-u16 input depth.** The `Sample for u16` impl hard-codes
   `bits_per_sample = 16`; many RAW paths carry right-aligned 12/14-bit code values
   in u16 storage. `JxlEncoderSetFrameBitDepth(JXL_BIT_DEPTH_FROM_CODESTREAM)` +
   a per-`Frame` `bits_per_sample`/`IntegerInputRange` lets libjxl read them
   correctly and can drop an upstream normalization pass. **Needs:** `SetFrameBitDepth`
   binding + `Frame` field. Feature/behavioral — defer.

4. **Mixed-precision planar extra channels.** `ExtraChannel<'a, S>` forces every
   extra plane to the color sample type, which can force a conversion buffer (e.g.
   float RGB + u16 depth/thermal, or mixed-precision HSI). libjxl accepts an
   independent `JxlPixelFormat` + `JxlExtraChannelInfo` per extra channel. Replacing
   the generic with a small tagged `ExtraData` enum (U8/U16/F16/F32) + optional
   per-extra distance preserves native side-channel layout. **Needs:** API change
   (breaks the `ExtraChannel<S>` signature); no FFI additions. Defer — out of scope
   for a byte-exact pass, but the cleanest of the four to land.

5. **Sealed `Sample` trait + `const` metadata.** `Sample` is `pub` and hands raw
   bytes to C; a downstream impl on a padded type declared as a libjxl pixel format
   is a footgun. Sealing it and turning `data_type()`/`bits_per_sample()` into assoc
   `const`s removes the extension point and lets LLVM drop the tiny metadata call
   layer. Pure safety/codegen; no external impls exist today, so it's churn-for-~0 —
   deferred as optional hardening, not a perf win.

**Measurement note (rule 9):** the landed hint change is not meaningfully
flip-floppable — encode wall time is libjxl-internal-bound and a same-format reuse
is neutral; the win is fewer first-frame grow-loop reallocations on u16/float/extra
frames and a footprint-stable estimate across reuse. Adopted under rule 10
(theoretically better metric, provably never worse, output byte-exact). A direct
reserve-accuracy micro-benchmark (count grow-loop iterations per format) is possible
if a number is wanted, but wall-time A/B would only measure libjxl noise.
Investigated and rejected; logged in `docs/1 rejected optimizations.md` as FS-R4. The 8-lane
FNV hash IS a serial recurrence (the real throughput ceiling), and a metrics-only entry
would skip it — but **every actual caller needs the hash**. The only production consumer is
the WASM `frame_stats` export, which emits `frameHashInt` AND luma stats; the only native
callers are two bench examples that discard the result. A hash-free native entry point would
have zero callers = unreachable abstraction. Revisit only when a concrete caller wants
metrics without the change-id.
