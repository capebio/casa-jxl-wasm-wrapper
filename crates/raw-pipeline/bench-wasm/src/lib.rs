//! wasm-bindgen bench shims for the perceptual PSNR (SSD) kernel.
//!
//! Exposes the real v128 `ssd_wasm` from raw-pipeline alongside an independent
//! scalar reference, so the node harness can (a) assert exact parity and (b) time
//! SIMD vs scalar in a real wasm runtime. `bench()` runs the inner loop entirely
//! inside wasm, so the wasm-bindgen slice copy is paid once per call, not per iter.
