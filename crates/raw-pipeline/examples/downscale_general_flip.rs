//! downscale_general_flip — A/B for the x0/x1 loop-invariant hoist in box_downscale_rgba8.
//!
//! The general (non-exact-ratio) branch computes x0/x1 per pixel. x0/x1 depend only on
//! dx/sw/dw, NOT on dy, so they can be precomputed once per column (dx) and reused for
//! every row (dy). This saves 2 u64 divides × dw × (dh-1) iterations.
//!
//!   A = baseline: x0/x1 computed inside dy loop (pre-hoist)
//!   B = hoisted:  x_ranges Vec precomputed outside dy loop (post-hoist)
//!
//! Output is byte-identical (same arithmetic, just reordered). Interleaved start-rotated;
//! round 0 dropped; median + stdev reported.
//!
//! Run: cd crates/raw-pipeline && cargo run --release --no-default-features --example downscale_general_flip
