//! box_downscale_hoist_flip — thermal-cancelled A/B for casabio_encode.rs
//! `box_downscale_rgba8`. Handoff items 2 (hoist stride math) + 7 (enumerate x_ranges).
//!
//! Box downscale runs once per cascade step (full→preview→thumb) and once per
//! pyramid sidecar level. Bandwidth-bound; the question is whether LLVM already
//! hoists the per-row `sw*4` / per-pixel `dw*4` index math and elides the
//! `x_ranges[dx]` bounds check — i.e. whether items 2+7 are real or compiler-neutral.
//!
//!   A = current:  per-row `&src[y*sw*4..]`, per-pixel `(dy*dw+dx)*4`, indexed `x_ranges[dx]`.
//!   B = hoisted:  precomputed `src_stride=sw*4`, `dst_stride=dw*4`, `x_ranges.iter().enumerate()`.
//!
//! Both exact-ratio (integer factor) and general (non-integer) paths are exercised.
//! Interleaved start-rotated rounds; round 0 dropped; median + %saved. Parity byte-EXACT.
//!
//! Run: cd crates/raw-pipeline && cargo run --release --no-default-features --example box_downscale_hoist_flip
