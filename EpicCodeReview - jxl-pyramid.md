# EpicCodeReview

**Target:** `packages/jxl-pyramid/src/` (focus: decode-level.ts, choose-level.ts, tiled-decode-pool.ts)
**Branch reviewed:** `performance/jxl-pyramid-warm-pool` (worktree)
**Mode:** workalone | **Status:** review-only (user halted before fix stage)
**Generated:** 2026-06-09

## Summary

- **111 candidates** raised by 6 finders (CodeQL skipped — not on PATH)
- **93 confirmed** by verifier — 2 critical, 17 high, 39 medium, 29 low, 6 info
- **2 uncertain** → see Open questions
- **16 false positives** dismissed

**One-line verdict:** Hot path is structurally sound for 8-bit happy path; 16-bit support is silently broken end-to-end through worker + dist, and the warm pool lacks cancellation, timeout, factory-isolation, and dispose — most acute risks are correctness (16-bit), safety (untrusted JXTC header), and pool lifecycle.

## Findings (confirmed)

### Critical (2)

**packages/jxl-pyramid/dist/tiled-decode-pool.js**
- L1-90 **dist/tiled-decode-pool.js is severely stale vs src — missing 16-bit path, missing persistent pool, missing transferable, missing error/messageerror listeners**
  - _Evidence:_ Direct read of dist/tiled-decode-pool.js (90 lines) confirms: line 1 imports only decodeTileContainerRegionRgba8 (no rgba16); line 4 hardcodes `viewport.w * viewport.h * 4`; line 38-61 reimplements per-frame Array.from(factory) + finally-terminate (no PyramidWorkerPool class). di

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiled-decode-pool.ts**
- L366-425 **Parallel worker pool path silently corrupts 16-bit tiled containers (worker.js only decodes rgba8)**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified web/lightbox/tiled-decode-worker.js line 9 calls decodeTileContainerRegionRgba8 unconditionally; no 16-bit branch. The pool path (decodeTiledViewportPooled) passes header.bitsPerSample to bppFor() and uses 8bpp stitch buffer when bits=16, but worker output is 4bpp. stitc


### High (17)

**packages/jxl-pyramid/dist/decode-level.js**
- L1-82 **dist/decode-level.js is stale: only imports decodeTileContainerRegionRgba8 — no 16-bit path, no pickRegionDecoder(bits), no bpp parametrization**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed by reading dist/decode-level.js: imports only decodeTileContainerRegionRgba8 (line 1), stitchTileDecodes hardcodes *4 (lines 31-39), no pickRegionDecoder, no bits parameter, no rgba16 branch. dist/level-source.js similarly omits bitsPerSample from the tiled result. dist

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/choose-level.ts**
- L13-15 **chooseLevelForTarget sorts by pixel area but selects by long edge — picks the wrong level when area order disagrees with long-edge order**
  - _Evidence:_ Math is correct: with levels [{w:200,h:900,area:180000,longEdge:900}, {w:600,h:600,area:360000,longEdge:600}] sorted by area gives [200x900, 600x600]. find(longEdge>=550) returns 200x900 first. The doc-stated 'smallest pyramid level' should be 600x600. Standard pyramid levels (PY
- L8-16 **chooseLevelForTarget allocates and sorts a new array on every viewport/zoom change**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: choose-level.ts:13 allocates `[...levels]` + sort on every call. web/lightbox/pyramid-lightbox.js:61 calls chooseLevelForTarget from pickLevel(zoomPct) which is invoked on every wheel/zoom interaction. web/pyramid-gallery/grid-controller.js:105 calls it from paintCell 

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/decode-level.ts**
- L60-83 **stitchTileDecodes pixel-buffer allocation has unchecked multiplication overflow**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified decode-level.ts:65 and tiled-decode-pool.ts:41 both use unchecked w*h*bpp allocations. The viewport derives from clamps against source.width/height which come unchecked from JXTC header (level-source.ts:21-22). Worker output dims arrive at tiled-decode-pool.ts:87-88 with
- L114-119 **Promise.all over tile decodes has no AbortSignal — first failure leaves remaining tiles racing to completion with no cancellation**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified decode-level.ts:89-122. Function signature accepts no AbortSignal in options (lines 92-95). The RegionDecoder type (lines 15-18) has no signal parameter. Promise.all on line 114 fans out N tile decodes with no abort coordination — first rejection abandons in-flight WASM 
- L20-45 **decodeWhole leaks decoder if push/close/drain reject before dispose**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 39-42 await push, close, drain, dispose sequentially with no try/finally. If decoder.push throws (malformed input), or the drain IIFE's 'error' branch (line 35) throws, decoder.dispose() is never invoked. WASM heap buffers and session state remain until GC reclaims the deco
- L29-41 **drain IIFE rejection becomes unhandled if push/close throws first**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 29-38 start the drain IIFE immediately. Lines 39-41 await push, close, drain in order. If await decoder.push(bytes) rejects, the function unwinds before await drain is reached. drain remains an in-flight promise; if it later rejects (e.g., the 'error' event was already buff

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/level-source.ts**
- L5-28 **LevelSource kind="whole" silently discards PyramidLevel.bitsPerSample — 16-bit whole-frame levels decode as 8-bit**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: level-source.ts:5-7 "whole" variant has no bitsPerSample, createLevelSource on line 10 picks only "w"|"h"|"tiled" (drops bitsPerSample), and decode-level.ts:22 decodeWhole hardcodes `format: "rgba8"`. web/lightbox/pyramid-lightbox.js:52 filters levels by `l.bitsPerSamp

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiled-decode-pool.ts**
- L304-321 **Module-singleton pool captures the first caller's workerFactory and ignores all subsequent factories**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified: module-level `let pool: PyramidWorkerPool | null = null;` (line 304) and `if (pool && !pool['destroyed']) return pool;` (line 307). The incoming `factory` argument is silently ignored when a pool exists. Combined with logic-006 (destroyed never set), second callers with
- L338-357 **Worker death between tile jobs in coroutine slicing can cause indefinite hang — postMessage to terminated worker returns no response**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified tiled-decode-pool.ts:234-258 (spawnOne attaches permanent recycle listener; recycle calls destroyHandle which calls worker.terminate()) and 338-357 (coros hold a WorkerLike reference and call decodeTileWithWorker in each loop iteration). If recycle fires between iteratio
- L68-124 **decodeTileWithWorker has no timeout and no per-call abort — if worker silently never replies, promise hangs forever**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified tiled-decode-pool.ts:68-124. The Promise executor installs only message/error/messageerror listeners. No setTimeout, no AbortSignal, no health-check ping. The single hang-resistance mechanism is the permanent recycle listener in spawnOne (separate scope) — it terminates 
- L372-426 **decodeTiledViewportPooled cannot be cancelled — pan/zoom in UI keeps in-flight decode running and holds pool workers busy**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiled-decode-pool.ts:372-426. The options type (lines 374-379) explicitly omits AbortSignal. decodeTilesParallel (line 323-364) similarly has no abort plumbing. The active workers set (line 149) gets populated by acquire() but only released when the decode resolves/re
- L68-124 **decodeTileWithWorker never times out — hung worker stalls the pool slot forever**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:68-124 — the Promise has no setTimeout / AbortController arm. Only message-with-id, 'error', and 'messageerror' resolve it. If the worker hangs in WASM, the promise never settles; the await in decodeTilesParallel coro (line 345) blocks indefinitely; relea
- L381-397 **parseJxtcHeader called on every decodeTiledViewportPooled invocation**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: tiled-decode-pool.ts:381 calls parseJxtcHeader on every invocation; pyramid-decode.js:16 calls decodeTiledViewportPooled inside a closure that is re-created per decode request. The sibling decodeTiledViewport in decode-level.ts accepts a pre-parsed LevelSource. Real wa

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiling.ts**
- L37-51 **parseJxtcHeader reads attacker-controlled uint32 dims with no range validation**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiling.ts:42-50. Five uint32 fields read with no bounds checking and returned to createLevelSource (level-source.ts:17-25), which assigns header.imageW/imageH/tileSize verbatim to source.{width,height,tileSize}. Downstream allocations at decode-level.ts:65 and tiled-d
- L61-96 **tilesOverlappingRegion can produce unbounded tile-list growth from attacker-controlled imageW/H/tileSize**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified tiling.ts:61-96 has no cap on the (tyMax-tyMin+1)*(txMax-txMin+1) iteration count. decode-level.ts:136 confirms `roi = { x: 0, y: 0, w: source.width, h: source.height }` for null region. Whole-level decode path forces tile generation across the full image area. Chained w

**web/pyramid-gallery/image-store.js**
- L21-29 **No runtime schema validation at manifest.json boundary — JSON.parse cast directly to PyramidManifest**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: image-store.js:26 does `const manifest = await res.json()` with no shape check. Confirmed via Glob + Grep that no schema.ts exists in pyramid-ingest/src (files: backends, cli, hash, index, ingest, ladder, manifest, quality, raw-backend, rgb16, shard) and grep for `prod


### Medium (39)

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src**
- L0-0 **No shared assertion/invariant utility — pyramid coord/level math sprawls without a check-once-per-boundary discipline**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified three independent clamp sites: decode-level.ts:100-103, tiled-decode-pool.ts:382-385, tiling.ts:68-71. Verified no byteLength assertion in either stitch function. Concrete evidence of need: logic-001 (16-bit worker corruption) would be mechanically caught by an assertDec

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/choose-level.ts**
- L1-26 **No memo / pre-sort cache for pyramid level picker**
  - _Evidence:_ choose-level.ts:13 copies and sorts on every invocation. No WeakMap or module-level cache exists in the file. `levelRank` (line 19-21) is a pure function and is recomputed by `shouldUpgrade` on each call. A WeakMap memo on the levels array is a small, clean fit; PyramidLevel arra

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/decode-level.ts**
- L89-122 **decodeTiledViewport does Promise.all fan-out with no concurrency cap on non-worker path**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified decode-level.ts:107-119. The parallel path (line 114) calls Promise.all over the full tiles array with no chunking or semaphore. tiles.length is itself unbounded (see security-c3d4e5f6). decodeRegion ultimately calls decodeTileContainerRegionRgba{8,16} which allocates a 
- L114-122 **Promise.all short-circuit leaks in-flight tile decodes on first failure**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 114-119 use Promise.all with no per-tile .catch and no AbortSignal. CLAUDE.md confirms 'decoder.push() (WASM) is synchronous — cannot yield mid-push'. Sibling decode promises continue running and their rejections (if any) become unhandled. The contrast with tiled-decode-poo
- L75-80 **stitchTileDecodes allocates a Uint8Array subarray view per row in fallback path**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 75-80 confirm per-row subarray() allocation; each row creates a new Uint8Array view object. Same code pattern exists at tiled-decode-pool.ts:51-55. The allocation overhead is real, though Uint8Array.prototype.set has no zero-alloc range-copy overload, so the proposed fix pa

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/fixtures.ts**
- L14-56 **APPROVED_FIXTURES is re-exported as part of public surface but contains Windows absolute paths (c:\\Foo\\...) — leaks dev-machine paths into the package public API**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: fixtures.ts:15-56 exports APPROVED_FIXTURES with hardcoded `c:\Foo\...` and `c:\995\...` paths. index.ts:7 re-exports it via `export * from "./fixtures.js"`. The const lives in src/ (not test/) so it ships in the public bundle and type definitions, leaking dev-machine 

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/grid-layout.ts**
- L15-22 **layoutFromIndex divides by aspect with no guard against zero/NaN/negative**
  - _Evidence:_ src/grid-layout.ts:15-22 — entry.aspect comes from GalleryIndexEntry (manifest.ts:56-60) and is typed `number` with no runtime validation. If aspect is 0, rowSpan = Infinity. Math.round(Infinity) is Infinity (not NaN), and Math.max(1, Infinity) is Infinity. CSS grid will silently
- L21-21 **rowSpan formula collapses to 1/aspect — base cancels out, formula ignores column width**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: `(base / aspect) / base` = `1 / aspect`. base is mathematically eliminated. The docstring says rows are scaled by columnWidthPx but the formula ignores it. For typical aspects (>=0.5), rowSpan is always 1 — visibly wrong layout for any non-square grid sizing. Either th

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/level-source.ts**
- L9-28 **createLevelSource propagates unchecked JXTC header dims to LevelSource width/height**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified level-source.ts:9-25. The function signature even includes entry.w/h via Pick<PyramidLevel, 'w' | 'h' | 'tiled'> but ignores them for the tiled branch. Whole branch uses entry.w/h (line 27), tiled branch uses header.imageW/imageH (lines 21-22). No cross-validation. Inver

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/manifest.ts**
- L35-46 **No runtime schema validation (Zod) for PyramidManifest / GalleryIndex at boundary**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified manifest.ts has only TypeScript interfaces, no Zod schemas. grep for 'zod' across the worktree returned no matches in jxl-pyramid (despite WU-1 zod adoption noted in CLAUDE.md for pyramid-ingest, that work hasn't reached this package). grid-layout.ts:21 confirms the aspe
- L17-46 **pyramid-ingest and jxl-pyramid define structurally-similar but separate manifest interfaces — no shared type, compile-time drift possible**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: pyramid-ingest/src/manifest.ts:22-32 declares Manifest with `proxy?: true` (narrow literal), and jxl-pyramid/src/manifest.ts:36-46 declares PyramidManifest with `proxy?: boolean` (wider). pyramid-ingest's isUpToDate() (line 101) reads `existing.proxy !== true` so the f
- L36-46 **No runtime schema version check — schema:1 declared as literal type but never verified at parse**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: PyramidManifest.schema and GalleryIndex.schema are literal `1` (manifest.ts:37, 64) but image-store.js:26 does plain JSON.parse and the package itself never checks schema version. No runtime version guard exists.

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiled-decode-pool.ts**
- L62-90 **WorkerReply.pixels typed as ArrayBuffer but worker posts a Uint8Array — `new Uint8Array(ab)` copies instead of wrapping**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified worker at web/lightbox/tiled-decode-worker.js line 10: `self.postMessage({ id, ok: true, pixels: out.pixels, ... }, [out.pixels.buffer])`. `out.pixels` is a Uint8Array; structured clone preserves the typed-array view (even when buffer transferred). On receiver, ev.data.p
- L261-273 **armIdleTimer arms only the just-released handle — handles enqueued earlier when idle count was below minIdle are never reaped**
  - _Evidence:_ Traced the logic: armIdleTimer only arms a timer on the just-released handle and only when idle.length > minIdle. Walkthrough with minIdle=2: release w1 (idle=1, no timer), release w2 (idle=2, no timer), release w3 (idle=3, timer on w3 only). w3 reaps after 5s, idle=2 again. Next
- L76-92 **Worker message handler trusts ev.data shape without validation**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiled-decode-pool.ts:76-92. WorkerReply is TS-only (lines 62-64). The handler does no runtime shape/type checks. Compromised worker output flows directly into stitchTileDecodes (line 87-89 returns the raw width/height). Threat model treats workers as a trust boundary 
- L66-73 **Module-scoped nextWorkerId is shared across all pool callers and never reset — collision risk if module loaded twice (HMR / multiple bundles)**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiled-decode-pool.ts:66 and 73. The id is module-scoped and never reset. Workers do persist across decode calls via the pool (workers are reused — see decodeTilesParallel coros at line 338), so HMR scenario is plausible. Worker handle does not track outstanding reques
- L304-321 **Module-scoped `pool` singleton is never destroyable — no exported shutdown(), and `pool['destroyed']` is never set to true**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiled-decode-pool.ts:152 (`private destroyed = false;`) and grep for 'destroyed =' shows it is only ever set to false at declaration. No setter, no shutdown/dispose method. Line 304 module-scope `pool` variable has no export reset. Tests cannot tear it down between ru
- L306-321 **Pool singleton binds to the first-seen workerFactory — subsequent callers passing a different factory are silently ignored**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiled-decode-pool.ts:306-321. The first call captures `factory` into the new PyramidWorkerPool constructor; subsequent calls hit the cache and ignore the passed factory. API contract gap is real: decodeTiledViewportPooled accepts workerFactory per call (line 378) but 
- L110-123 **worker.postMessage is not wrapped in try/catch — synchronous throw (DataCloneError, terminated worker) prevents promise from ever settling**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiled-decode-pool.ts:110-123. The try/catch on lines 111-116 only guards the addEventListener calls (for test doubles), not the postMessage call at line 122. A synchronous postMessage throw escapes the Promise executor and leaves the promise pending forever. DataClone
- L186-214 **No backpressure / queue on acquire — pool at cap returns fewer workers and caller silently falls back to single-WASM decode**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 186-214 show acquire() drains idle then spawns up to maxSize, then returns. No waiter queue. Lines 414-418 confirm the fallback to single-WASM decodeRegion when liveWorkers.length === 0. Pattern matches finding exactly; behavior is silently sub-optimal for concurrent ROI ba
- L234-250 **Permanent recycle listener is never removed — accumulates across worker lifetime; harmless per-worker but no removal on destroyHandle**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 242-248 add 'error'/'messageerror' listeners. destroyHandle (lines 288-301) calls terminate() but never removeEventListener. The recycle() guard on line 253 (`if (!this.all.has(h)) return`) protects correctness, but the listener-removal omission is observable, as described.
- L192-214 **acquire() does not verify a warm idle worker is actually responsive — silent-fail workers stay in idle until they error**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 192-201 only check h.terminated, h.bad, and this.all.has(h). decodeTileWithWorker (lines 68-124) has no timeout, so a wedged worker causes the promise to hang indefinitely. There is no liveness mechanism beyond worker-emitted error events (lines 244-245).
- L204-212 **spawn-on-demand uses try/catch around spawnOne, but a partial spawn (factory creates Worker that fails immediately) puts a bad handle into `active` then breaks the loop — caller never releases this handle**
  - _Evidence:_ The race is concrete: spawnOne at lines 234-250 returns a handle with permanent 'error'/'messageerror' listeners pointing to recycle (which calls destroyHandle, line 258, removing from all). If the worker errors before/during decodeTileWithWorker dispatch, recycle removes the han
- L117-123 **containerBytes is structured-cloned N times (once per tile) — N parallel postMessage of the same large buffer is a hidden N x copy cost**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 117-122 contain an explicit acknowledgment from the codebase: 'bytes (full JXTC container) is structured-cloned here'. postMessage at line 122 has no transferable list. canUseParallelTileWorkers() in tiling.ts asserts SAB preconditions (per comment) but this code does not e
- L234-302 **No periodic health monitor — a worker that loaded WASM but later starts failing every tile sits in idle/active rotation until terminated by error event**
  - _Evidence:_ recycle() (lines 252-259) is only invoked from the worker error/messageerror events (lines 242-247). decodeTileWithWorker (lines 90-92) rejects on `ok:false` but does not propagate to the pool to mark the handle bad. A worker stuck returning ok:false would be returned to idle by 
- L204-213 **spawnOne failure is swallowed with no logging or escalation**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:204-212 — bare `catch { break; }` with no logging. Verified against jxl-scheduler/pool.ts which has spawnFailed metric and a console.warn for spawn timeout (line 388-393). This pool has none of that observability.
- L242-248 **Silent catch on lifecycle addEventListener disables worker recycling**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:243-248 — silent catch around addEventListener. In standard browsers Worker.addEventListener is safe; the catch only exists for test doubles. In production a real throw here would leave the handle without recycle wiring; the comment acknowledges the test-
- L304-321 **Module-level pool ignores subsequent workerFactory arguments**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:304-321 — module-level singleton, factory argument used only on first call. No identity check, no reset API, no log on mismatch. In production single-app flow this is fine; in HMR/test/scenarios where worker URL changes between calls, the stale factory wi
- L333-364 **decodeTilesParallel allocates results array sized to caller-supplied tiles.length**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiling.ts:37-51 parses u32 dimensions with no upper bound. src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:333 calls `new Array(tiles.length)` — and tiles.length is driven by clamped viewport, but `tilesOverlappingRegion` iterates a double loop up to (txMax-txMin+1) * (tyMax-tyMin+1) (line 80-94) w
- L372-405 **decodeTiledViewport and decodeTiledViewportPooled have divergent signatures for the same logical operation**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: decode-level.ts:89-95 declares decodeTiledViewport(source: LevelSource tiled variant, ...) while tiled-decode-pool.ts:372-380 declares decodeTiledViewportPooled(containerBytes: Uint8Array, ...). Both are exported via index.ts. The pooled variant calls parseJxtcHeader o
- L141-302 **PyramidWorkerPool has no public dispose() / isDestroyed() — leaked module-scope pool can't be cleanly torn down by callers**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: class PyramidWorkerPool exposes only get size, prewarm, acquire, release (private spawnOne/recycle/armIdleTimer/clearIdleTimer/reap/destroyHandle). The `destroyed` flag is declared private (line 152) and read in destroy paths (lines 172, 187, 222, 235) but never writte
- L226-229 **release() does O(idle) Array.includes scan per worker returned**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: tiled-decode-pool.ts:227 does `if (!this.idle.includes(h)) this.idle.push(h)` — O(idle) per worker. With maxSize=8 it's bounded but the check shouldn't be needed: acquire moves handles to active and removes from idle (lines 193-199), so a released handle is never alrea
- L40-60 **stitch() in tiled-decode-pool.ts duplicates stitchTileDecodes from decode-level.ts**
  - _Evidence:_ Direct side-by-side comparison: tiled-decode-pool.ts lines 40-60 implements `stitch` and decode-level.ts lines 60-83 implements `stitchTileDecodes`. Both build a destination Uint8Array, have an identical fast-path check (`decoded.width === viewport.w && dx === 0`), and identical 
- L117-123 **Documentation of transferable convention is in a comment, not enforced**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified web/lightbox/tiled-decode-worker.js:10 does `self.postMessage({...}, [out.pixels.buffer])` — transfer enforced by hand on the worker side. Sender side (tiled-decode-pool.ts:80-83) trusts this via comment. Out-of-tree workers could silently drop the transfer list and the 

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiling.ts**
- L1-9 **No upper-bound cap on image/level dimensions before allocation**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified constants.ts and tiling.ts contain no MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION / MAX_TILE_COUNT constants. The existing MASSIVE_* thresholds gate ingest tiling decisions, not decode-side input validation. Pairs naturally with security-a1b2c3d4 and security-c3d4e5f6 as a unified hardening poi
- L37-51 **parseJxtcHeader accepts arbitrary u32 dimensions without sanity bounds**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiling.ts:37-51 reads five u32 dimension fields and only validates magic and version. No upper bound on imageW/imageH/tileSize or coherence check between (imageW, tileSize, tilesX). tileSize=0 is caught later in tilesOverlappingRegion line 67 but only inside that function — o
- L60-96 **tilesOverlappingRegion rebuilds tile grid every call; no cache by (imageW, imageH, tileSize)**
  - _Evidence:_ tiling.ts:61-96 confirmed: function always allocates a fresh `out` array and recomputes Math.floor/Math.min/Math.max for every tile in the visible subset. No cache exists. For pan-at-60Hz with dozens of tiles, the constant overhead is real. The opportunity self-rates 'worth a ben

**packages/jxl-pyramid/test**
- L0-0 **No fast-check / property-based tests for tilesOverlappingRegion, chooseLevelForTarget, or stitch geometry**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified test files in jxl-pyramid/test/ are single-shape only (choose-level.test.ts, tiling.test.ts use hardcoded inputs). Verified concrete value: a property test ∀ levels with mixed aspect ratios would surface logic-002 (the area-vs-longEdge sort mismatch) immediately. tilesOv

**packages/jxl-pyramid/test/pyramid.test.ts**
- L1-146 **No round-trip contract test: pyramid-ingest writes manifest → jxl-pyramid reads + decodes**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: pyramid.test.ts contains only constant verification, preset enumeration, fixture path checks, and a compile-time-only structural test. No imports of buildManifest from pyramid-ingest, no round-trip JSON parse → chooseLevelForTarget → createLevelSource → decodeLevel tes

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src**
- L0-0 **Region clamping is duplicated across decode-level.ts, tiled-decode-pool.ts, and tilesOverlappingRegion — extract clampRegionToImage(region, imageW, imageH)**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified three identical clamp blocks: decode-level.ts:100-103 (rx/ry/rw/rh on source.width/height), tiled-decode-pool.ts:382-385 (same on header.imageW/H), tiling.ts:68-71 (same on imageW/H). All three would change in lockstep for any boundary semantic shift. Trivial dedupe.

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/choose-level.ts**
- L8-16 **chooseLevelForTarget silently accepts NaN/negative/zero targetLongEdge**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 8-16 contain no Number.isFinite or >0 guard on targetLongEdge. NaN comparisons always return false in JS, so `.find()` returns undefined and the function returns the largest level (the fallback). For targetLongEdge=0 or negative, every level satisfies the predicate so the s

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/decode-level.ts**
- L99-106 **decodeTiledViewport region.x/y/w/h not checked for finite/non-NaN before clamp arithmetic**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified by running `new Uint8Array(NaN)` — produces length 0, does not throw. NaN <= 0 is false (NaN comparisons all return false), so the guard at decode-level.ts:104 is bypassed for NaN inputs. Same gap exists in tiled-decode-pool.ts:382-386 (decodeTiledViewportPooled has iden
- L100-105 **NaN region dimensions bypass empty-check and allocate huge buffer**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 100-104: NaN propagates through Math.min/Math.max. NaN < 0 is false, so the `rw <= 0 || rh <= 0` guard at line 104 fails to catch NaN. Subsequent flow uses viewport.w/h in stitchTileDecodes (line 65: `new Uint8Array(viewport.w * viewport.h * bpp)`) where NaN multiplication

  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: level-source.ts:7 declares bitsPerSample: 8 | 16 as required on the tiled variant; decode-level.ts:97 uses `source.bitsPerSample ?? 8`. The fallback is unreachable under the declared type. The same pattern appears in tiled-decode-pool.ts:389 `const bits = header.bitsPe
- L125-138 **decodeLevel throws on region+kind=whole but silently defaults region for kind=tiled — asymmetric contract**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: decode-level.ts:131-137 implements an asymmetric contract — region passed with whole throws, region omitted with tiled silently defaults to full ROI. The type signature `region?: ImageRegion` does not surface either constraint.
- L100-107 **Region clamping done twice: in caller and again inside tilesOverlappingRegion**
  - _Evidence:_ decode-level.ts lines 100-103 perform Math.min/Math.max clamping; tilesOverlappingRegion in tiling.ts lines 68-71 repeats the identical clamp on the already-clamped viewport. The same pattern appears in tiled-decode-pool.ts lines 382-385. The work is redundant but cheap; severity
- L20-45 **decodeWhole creates an IIFE async drain and awaits three independent promises**
  - _Evidence:_ decode-level.ts:29-42 confirms the IIFE drain pattern followed by four sequential awaits. The push/drain dataflow does naturally race (drain awaits events while push pumps them), but the chain of awaits adds microtask overhead. Self-rated low confidence and low severity since dec

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/grid-layout.ts**
- L15-22 **rowSpan formula (base / aspect) / base simplifies to 1 / aspect — `base` (columnWidthPx) is dead and the formula is unit-incoherent**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified algebra: (base / aspect) / base = 1 / aspect. The `base` variable from columnWidthPx is dead in the rowSpan computation. Function signature accepts columnWidthPx but doesn't use it meaningfully. Concrete failure: caller passing different columnWidthPx values gets identic
- L15-23 **layoutFromIndex assumes entry.aspect is positive — divide-by-zero or NaN propagates to rowSpan**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: grid-layout.ts:21 lacks any aspect-positivity guard; GalleryIndexEntry declares `aspect: number` with no refinement; combined with no manifest schema validation (contracts-004), aspect=0 or NaN from a bad index would propagate. Math.max(1, NaN) = NaN. The math bug susp

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/index.ts**
- L1-14 **No deprecation-warning framework — backwards-incompatible changes to exported surface have no migration path**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: index.ts is bulk star re-export with no JSDoc, no @deprecated annotations anywhere in src. Opportunity for a deprecation framework is valid but low severity; menu-listed gap.

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiled-decode-pool.ts**
- L141-321 **`destroyed` flag is checked in 4 places but never set — destroy() method missing, getOrCreatePool's guard is dead code**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified by reading the full file: `private destroyed = false;` (line 152). Checks at lines 172, 187, 222, 235, 307. No `this.destroyed = true` assignment anywhere in tiled-decode-pool.ts. Concrete consequence: in test / HMR / multi-tenant scenarios there's no recovery path; comb
- L40-60 **`stitch` in tiled-decode-pool.ts is byte-for-byte equivalent to `stitchTileDecodes` in decode-level.ts — divergence risk**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified by direct file comparison: tiled-decode-pool.ts:40-60 and decode-level.ts:60-83 have identical stitching logic — same fast-path condition (decoded.width === viewport.w && dx === 0), same per-row fallback with subarray copy. Divergence risk is real: any fix to one (e.g., 
- L66-124 **Global nextWorkerId is monotonic across all sessions; id reuse on overflow could mis-route worker replies**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified tiled-decode-pool.ts:66 and 73. ID is module-scoped and never reset. Each onMessage filters by `ev.data.id !== id`. Per-decode listeners are added (line 110), so multiple in-flight decodes on the same worker each see all messages — id uniqueness is the only routing guara
- L23-26 **Worker factory URL provenance is implicit; no allowlist defense if ever wired to manifest**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified tiled-decode-pool.ts:23-26 and 378. workerFactory is caller-supplied today (see pyramid-decode.js:18-22 — `new Worker(new URL('../lightbox/tiled-decode-worker.js', import.meta.url))` is a closed-over hard-coded URL). Severity is appropriately low (forward-looking hardeni
- L76-99 **onMessage handler does not check `settled` before resolving — late message after error path causes double-settle (benign but indicates contract gap)**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiled-decode-pool.ts:76-95. onError guards on `if (settled) return;` (line 95) but onMessage does not (line 76-93). cleanup() at line 100-109 sets settled=true. The race is real but benign because JS promises ignore subsequent settle calls. The asymmetry is the real f
- L171-179 **prewarm() returns synchronously but worker WASM module load is asynchronous — first request after prewarm may still pay the cold-start cost without observable signal**
  - _Evidence:_ prewarm() (lines 171-179) is synchronous and the JSDoc explicitly states 'their top-level preloadJxlModule() runs' which is asynchronous. No readiness mechanism is exposed by the pool API. The semantics are exactly as described; the comment 'Re-warm on first use' at line 317 conf
- L323-364 **decodeTilesParallel hand-rolls a coroutine slicer; a structured TaskGroup-style helper would handle cancellation, partial failure, and AbortSignal uniformly**
  - _Evidence:_ decodeTilesParallel (lines 323-364) and decodeTiledViewport in decode-level.ts (lines 114-119) both implement coroutine/Promise.all parallel-tile patterns. Neither accepts AbortSignal nor exposes progress. The opportunity for a shared helper is real and evidenced by duplication; 
- L329-332 **decodeTilesParallel returns [] when workers.length === 0, but caller's stitch over [] yields a zero-filled viewport — silent visual corruption**
  - _Evidence:_ Lines 329-332 do return [] on empty workers. stitch() at line 40-60 over empty parts produces an all-zero Uint8Array (allocation only, no fills). decodeTilesParallel is module-internal and only called from decodeTiledViewportPooled where line 414 guards, so the path is unreachabl
- L293-300 **worker.terminate() exceptions swallowed without logging**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:293-300 — silent catch around terminate(). Low risk in practice (browser Worker.terminate is void) but no observability if a shim or future implementation throws. The finding is accurate at low severity.
- L307-318 **Private field accessed via bracket notation bypasses encapsulation and typing**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:152 initializes `destroyed = false`; grep confirms no reassignment anywhere in the file. The class has no destroy() method. So `pool["destroyed"]` is invariantly false at line 307, making the !destroyed branch dead code. `p["minIdle"]` (line 318) is also 
- L76-99 **onMessage runs cleanup() unconditionally even if onError already fired**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:76-99 — onMessage has no `if (settled) return` guard, while onError does (line 95). Cleanup happens to be idempotent and Promise resolve/reject after settlement is a no-op, so no functional bug. The asymmetric guard is a clarity / consistency issue, corre
- L186-214 **acquire() declared async but does no awaits — concurrent callers race against shared state without queueing**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:186-214 — acquire is `async` but has no awaits. The fallback at lines 414-418 (caller) silently degrades to single-WASM decode when liveWorkers is empty. Not a correctness issue, but the silent degradation matches the description. Reasonable info-level fi
- L420-425 **release() in finally can throw and mask the decode error**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:420-425 — release() is called bare in finally. release() loops setTimeout-arming over each worker; any throw inside replaces the original decode error per JS semantics. The probability is low (release is mostly safe operations) but the masking pattern is 
- L306-321 **getOrCreatePool reads private fields via ["destroyed"] / ["minIdle"] bracket access — bypasses TS access control**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: tiled-decode-pool.ts:307 reads `pool["destroyed"]` and line 318 reads `p["minIdle"]`. Both fields are declared private (lines 145, 152). The bracket access compiles but is fragile to rename refactors. Note: the `destroyed` field is never set to true anywhere in the cla
- L306-321 **getOrCreatePool prewarms on first call — this is on the user's first interactive frame**
  - _Evidence:_ Code at tiled-decode-pool.ts:306-321 matches the description exactly. The pool is created lazily on first acquire, and `p.prewarm()` synchronously calls `spawnOne()` per worker (via `this.factory()`); web/lightbox/tiled-decode-worker.js imports and calls `preloadJxlModule()` at t

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiling.ts**
- L104-109 **canUseParallelTileWorkers returns false when `crossOriginIsolated` is undefined — Node.js worker_threads contexts always lose parallel path**
  - _Evidence:_ Verified at tiling.ts:107-108: returns false when crossOriginIsolated is undefined. Verified at decode-level.ts:108: parallel gate uses canUseParallelTileWorkers. Verified test at decode-level.test.ts:60: passes parallel:true but Bun/Node lacks crossOriginIsolated → wantParallel=
- L73-78 **Tile index math uses Math.floor((rx+rw-1)/tileSize) — overflow at edge**
  - _Evidence:_ The author's own analysis confirms NaN propagates safely to empty array (degrades to no-op) and u32 max can't overflow Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. The finding is low-priority defense-in-depth — caller-bug surfacing via Number.isFinite. Confirmed as info.
- L37-51 **JXTC container version is hardcoded to 1 in parser — no migration path documented or signaled**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: tiling.ts:41 throws on `getUint32(4) !== 1`. JxtcHeader interface (line 12-21) carries no version field, so consumers can't route on version. The check is correct but offers no migration path or version metadata. Informational; low priority.


### Info (6)

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/choose-level.ts**
- L15-15 **Trailing `?? null` is unreachable after non-empty length guard**
  - _Evidence:_ src/choose-level.ts:12 returns null when levels.length === 0, so sorted is non-empty afterward and sorted[sorted.length-1] is always defined. The trailing `?? null` on line 15 is unreachable. Strict TS noUncheckedIndexedAccess may need the fallback for type-safety, but at runtime
- L8-16 **chooseLevelForTarget re-sorts a readonly array on every call though manifest is already sorted ascending by ingest**
  - _Evidence:_ Confirmed: pyramid-ingest/src/manifest.ts:75 in buildManifest does `const levels = [...args.levels].sort((a, b) => a.w * a.h - b.w * b.h);` before writing. chooseLevelForTarget at choose-level.ts:13 re-sorts on every call. The PyramidManifest.levels type carries no ordering invar

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/decode-level.ts**
- L1-138 **All failure modes throw generic Error — no taxonomy for callers to discriminate**
  - _Evidence:_ src/decode-level.ts lines 35, 43, 104, 132 all throw `new Error(...)`. src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:91 and 97 also throw `new Error(...)`. Callers cannot discriminate by class. The opportunity to introduce sentinel error classes is real and aligns with CLAUDE.md's emphasis on disting

**packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiled-decode-pool.ts**
- L1-426 **Zero logging anywhere in the pool — spawn fail, recycle, fallback all silent**
  - _Evidence:_ Grep over src/tiled-decode-pool.ts for `console.` returns zero matches. Compare to jxl-scheduler/pool.ts which has console.warn (line 388, 585) and spawnFailed metric (line 22, 56, 306). This pool has no observability whatsoever. Reasonable info-level opportunity.
- L323-364 **No retry on transient worker failures — single failure aborts whole viewport**
  - _Evidence:_ src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:349-355 — first error sets `failed=true` and aborts all coros. The viewport-level call in decodeTiledViewportPooled (line 420-422) does not retry. For transient worker crashes, an opportunity to retry once on a fresh handle is reasonable. Info-level, opti
- L307-318 **Bracket-access of private fields defeats TypeScript and may inhibit JIT inlining**
  - _Evidence:_ tiled-decode-pool.ts:307 uses `pool["destroyed"]` and line 318 uses `p["minIdle"]` to bypass TS private-field visibility (declared at lines 152 and 145). Code-smell is real; the JIT-inlining concern is plausible but unverified. Severity 'info' is appropriate.

## Uncertain (deferred to QUESTIONS.md)

- `packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:333-364` **On first failure, sibling workers' in-flight WASM jobs continue and pollute next acquire**
  - _Why uncertain:_ The author's own analysis is internally inconsistent (concludes 'no in-flight job is orphaned in the literal sense' then speculates about a 'risk window' for stale replies). Each worker has only one in-flight Promise at a time (sequential await in the coro), and cleanup() removes
- `packages/jxl-pyramid/src/tiled-decode-pool.ts:338-357` **decodeTilesParallel mutates a sparse results array via late-binding indices**
  - _Why uncertain:_ Code structure matches the finding (lines 333-348). However, since `idx = next++` is monotonically increasing and writes complete (potentially out-of-order) at indices 0..N-1, the array is transiently holey but always fully populated before consumption.

## Strategic observations (action items)

### L1-1. Sibling-decoder divergence
- **Category:** bug-prone, perf
- **Issue:** Two source-of-truth schemes: decode-level reads LevelSource.bitsPerSample, pool re-parses JXTC header every call. Two stitch impls (byte-for-byte identical), two clamp blocks, two pickRegionDecoder selections.
- **Fix:** Extract `clampRegion`, `stitch`, `pickRegionDecoder` to shared helper (tiling.ts or new decode-core.ts). Pool entry should accept pre-parsed header to skip re-parse.

### L1-2. Pool path bypasses LevelSource
- **Category:** perf + contract
- **Issue:** Pool takes raw bytes — caller already has bits/dims from manifest but pool re-discovers them via header parse on hot path.
- **Fix:** Add overload `decodeTiledViewportPooled(source: LevelSource, region, opts)` reusing manifest dims; keep raw-bytes overload for transitional callers.

### L1-3. choose-level re-sorts every viewport change
- **Category:** speed + efficiency
- **Issue:** `[...levels].sort(…)` allocates + O(n log n) on every pan/zoom/IntersectionObserver fire. Manifest is pre-sorted ascending by pyramid-ingest.
- **Fix:** Drop the sort (`levels.find(l => longEdge(l.w, l.h) >= target) ?? last ?? null`). If defensive sort wanted: memoize per-levels-identity via WeakMap.

### L1-4. `decodeTilesParallel` is a half-built scheduler
- **Category:** bug + missing feature
- **Issue:** Hand-rolled coroutine slicer with no cancellation, no per-tile timeout, no work-stealing replacement on failure. First failure orphans in-flight work.
- **Fix:** Thread `AbortSignal` through `decodeTiledViewportPooled → decodeTilesParallel → decodeTileWithWorker → onMessage/onError`. Add per-call timeout configured at pool construction.

### L1-5. Singleton pool ignores subsequent workerFactory
- **Category:** bug + missing feature
- **Issue:** `getOrCreatePool(factory)` binds first factory forever — test swaps, HMR, per-gallery factories no-op. `destroyed` flag read 4 places, written 0.
- **Fix:** Add `PyramidWorkerPool.destroy()` (sets destroyed, drains active+idle). Detect factory-identity change in `getOrCreatePool` and rebuild. Export `disposeWorkerPool()`.

### L1-6. decodeWhole hardcodes rgba8 — 16-bit whole-frame silently downsampled
- **Category:** critical bug
- **Issue:** `decodeWhole` (L22) → `createDecoder({ format: 'rgba8' })`. `LevelSource.kind='whole'` carries bitsPerSample but level-source.ts strips it via Pick.
- **Fix:** Thread `bits: 8|16` through `decodeWhole(bytes, bits)` → `format: bits===16 ? 'rgba16' : 'rgba8'`. Stop the `Pick` in level-source.ts.

### L1-7. Worker structured-clone amplification
- **Category:** perf
- **Issue:** `postMessage({bytes, region})` per tile per worker. 16 tiles × 4 workers = up to 64 copies of multi-MB JXTC container. Comment L117-121 acknowledges.
- **Fix:** Send container **once per worker** at acquire-time via `{type:'load', bytesId, bytes}`. Worker caches `bytesId → bytes`. Subsequent tile decodes send `{id, bytesId, region}` only. Worker.js protocol bump.

### L1-8. Pool fallback bypasses the pool
- **Category:** perf + missing feature
- **Issue:** When `liveWorkers.length === 0` (pool at cap), pool falls back to main-thread single `decodeRegion` (L417). Slower than queuing.
- **Fix:** Expose `pool.awaitOne()`: resolves when worker frees. Bounded wait; main-thread WASM only on timeout. Acquisition queue ≠ pixel-buffer pool (no transferable conflict).

### L1-9. Sort-key vs select-key mismatch in chooseLevelForTarget
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** `levelRank = w*h` but selection uses `longEdge`. With mixed aspect ratios, smallest-rank fails long-edge test → fall-through picks 'largest' rather than next-larger-by-long-edge.
- **Fix:** Sort by `longEdge` (or eliminate sort per L1-3) so `find(longEdge ≥ target)` is monotone.

### L1-10. No header memoization across pool calls
- **Category:** perf
- **Issue:** Each `decodeTiledViewportPooled` re-parses 32-byte header per ROI. Header is immutable per-level. Pan/zoom over same level → repeated parse.
- **Fix:** WeakMap<Uint8Array, JxtcHeader> cache keyed by `containerBytes` identity. Better still: thread `header` through caller (see L1-2).

### L1-11. CLAUDE.md crosscheck
- **Category:** info
- **Issue:** None of L1-1…L1-10 conflict with the rejected-claims list. Transferable + SAB constraints respected. Worker-input bytes pool is read-only — distinct from rejected pixel-buffer pool.

# Lens 2 — Hot-path allocations

Pan/zoom UI fires `chooseLevelForTarget` + `decodeTiledViewportPooled`/`decodeTiledViewport` at frame rate. Each per-call allocation is multiplied by FPS × tile-count.

### L2-1. `decodeRegion` arrow allocated per call (pool)
- **Category:** perf
- **Issue:** `tiled-decode-pool.ts` L390-395: when `options?.decodeRegion` absent, a fresh `async (bytes, r) => {...}` closure + branch object is allocated on every `decodeTiledViewportPooled` invocation. Same closure for the entire lifetime of a given level.
- **Fix:** Hoist to module scope: `const _decode8 = async (b,r) => ...; const _decode16 = async (b,r) => ...; const decodeRegion = options?.decodeRegion ?? (bits===16 ? _decode16 : _decode8);` — zero per-call alloc.

### L2-2. `[...levels].sort` per UI frame (choose-level)
- **Category:** efficiency + speed
- **Issue:** L13 allocates new array + comparator call per UI frame; cite L1-3 / perf-a1b2c3d4.
- **Fix:** Drop the sort (manifest pre-sorted). Final code: `return levels.find(l => longEdge(l.w, l.h) >= targetLongEdge) ?? levels[levels.length - 1] ?? null;` — zero alloc per call.

### L2-3. `Promise.all(tiles.map(async ...))` per ROI (decode-level)
- **Category:** perf
- **Issue:** L114-119 `tiles.map` allocates intermediate array of Promises + closure per tile + `{region, decoded}` object literal per tile. For 16-tile viewport: 16 closures + 16 promises + 16 literals + 1 intermediate array per ROI.
- **Fix:** Restructure as preallocated `parts = new Array(tiles.length)` with a coroutine-style for-await loop (same shape as pool's `decodeTilesParallel`). Eliminates the intermediate Promise array and `.map`'s allocator chain.

### L2-4. Per-row `subarray` view in stitch fallback path
- **Category:** perf (low)
- **Issue:** Both files: partial-width tiles take `decoded.pixels.subarray(srcOff, srcOff+srcStride)` per row → 24-byte view object per row. For 1024-tall viewport with mixed-width tiles: ~1k view allocs per stitch.
- **Fix:** Two options. (a) Compute `srcOff` and `dstOff` and call `pixels.set(decoded.pixels.subarray(srcOff, srcOff+srcStride), dstOff)` — same as now; can't avoid subarray for cross-buffer offset+offset copy. (b) Use a worker-side packer that writes directly into a shared output offset (out of scope here). Accept; mark info. The current fast-path branch already wins for the common case.

### L2-5. `setTimeout(() => ..., ms)` closure per `armIdleTimer`
- **Category:** perf (low)
- **Issue:** L268: each release into idle arms a fresh arrow closure capturing `h`. Bounded by `maxSize` (≤8) but every release triggers it.
- **Fix:** Use `setTimeout`'s 3rd-arg passthrough: `globalThis.setTimeout(this._reapBound, idleTimeoutMs, h)` with a pre-bound `_reapBound = (h) => { if (this.idle.includes(h) && ...) this.reap(h); }` on the instance. Single closure for the pool lifetime.

### L2-6. `idle.includes(h)` linear scan per release
- **Category:** perf
- **Issue:** L227: `if (!this.idle.includes(h)) this.idle.push(h)` — O(idle) per worker returned. Already perf-c3d4e5f6. With minIdle=2 + bursty release: O(maxSize) per call.
- **Fix:** Track idle membership on the handle itself: `h.inIdle: boolean`. Set true on push, false on shift/reap. `if (!h.inIdle) { h.inIdle = true; this.idle.push(h); }`. O(1).

### L2-7. `new Array(tiles.length)` sparse pre-size (pool)
- **Category:** perf (engine-dependent)
- **Issue:** L333: `new Array(N)` creates HOLEY array. V8 transitions to dictionary mode for large holey arrays. Coroutines fill in random order (work-stealing) → never becomes PACKED.
- **Fix:** Use `[]` then `results.length = tiles.length`? Worse. Best: `Array.from({length: tiles.length}, () => null)` — PACKED, all slots `null` initially. Per-tile write replaces null with `{region, decoded}`. Marginal but real for large tile counts.

### L2-8. `parseJxtcHeader(containerBytes)` repeated per ROI
- **Category:** perf
- **Issue:** L381: cite L1-10 / perf-b2c3d4e5. 32-byte parse per ROI. Same bytes across pan/zoom on same level.
- **Fix:** WeakMap-cache (see L1-10). For Lens-2 purposes: same root cause as L1-2 (pool ignores manifest-known dims). Either fix removes the alloc.

### L2-9. `decodeWhole` IIFE async drain (decode-level)
- **Category:** perf
- **Issue:** L20-45: `createDecoder({...})` per call (mandatory — stream decoder), plus `(async () => { for await ...})()` IIFE allocates Generator + Promise. Three sequential awaits.
- **Fix:** Use the streaming API the same way but reuse a module-level `createDecoder` config object literal (saves one alloc per call): hoist `const WHOLE_DECODER_OPTS = Object.freeze({ format: 'rgba8', ... })`. Minor but free.

### L2-10. FEATURE: per-level `DecodePlan` cache
- **Category:** feature opportunity
- **Issue:** Every pan/zoom recomputes: clamped viewport, tile list, header parse, decodeRegion selection. All deterministic on `(LevelSource, region)`.
- **Fix:** Introduce `prepareDecodePlan(source, region) → { viewport, tiles, header, decodeRegion }` cached on the LevelSource (WeakMap). decode-level + pool both consume the same plan. Eliminates ~5 distinct hot-path allocs in one shot. Pairs with L1-1 extract-helpers refactor.

### L2-11. FEATURE: stitch buffer reuse across pan
- **Category:** feature opportunity (constrained)
- **Issue:** Output `pixels` alloc dominates byte cost: `viewport.w * viewport.h * bpp`. For 2048×1024×4 = 8 MB per stitch. Pan throws old pixels away.
- **Fix:** Caller-owned buffer: `decodeTiledViewportPooled(bytes, region, { outBuffer?: Uint8Array, ... })`. Caller maintains a single recyclable Uint8Array sized to viewport max. CLAUDE.md rejects pixel-buffer pool because *transferred* buffers detach — this is caller-owned, not transferred. Safe if caller commits to ownership semantics. Document the contract.

### L2-12. INFO: `decodeTileWithWorker` per-tile closure cost
- **Category:** info
- **Issue:** L74: per tile allocates new Promise + onMessage + onError + cleanup closures + `settled` flag. Inevitable for the request-response promise pattern. Mention only — bytes payload dwarfs this.


---

# Lens 3 - Worker protocol

Scope: `WorkerReply` union (L62-64), `decodeTileWithWorker` (L68-124), spawn/recycle wiring (L234-250), `decodeTilesParallel` driver (L323-364), implicit `web/lightbox/tiled-decode-worker.js` contract.

### L3-1. Request shape carries no `format` - worker hardcoded rgba8
- **Category:** critical bug
- **Issue:** Pool's `postMessage({id, bytes, region})` (L122) has no bits field. Worker calls only `decodeTileContainerRegionRgba8` regardless of source format. 16-bit tiled levels silently corrupt (cite logic-001 critical + L1-6).
- **Fix:** Extend request to `{id, bytes, region, format: 'rgba8'|'rgba16'}`. Worker switches on `format`. Pool passes `format: bits===16 ? 'rgba16' : 'rgba8'` derived once per level (see L2-1). Worker.js needs the parallel rgba16 decode wired.

### L3-2. No runtime validation of `WorkerReply` shape
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** L76-92 trusts `ev.data` as the typed union. A buggy worker sending `{id, ok:true}` (no pixels) crashes at `new Uint8Array(undefined)`. Untrusted-worker case (per security-d4e5f6a7) is plausible: extension-injected workers, dev-mode hot-swaps.
- **Fix:** Validate inside `onMessage`: check `typeof ev.data.id === 'number'`, `typeof ev.data.ok === 'boolean'`, then ok-branch requires pixels (ArrayBuffer or Uint8Array) + numeric width/height. Reject with `Error('malformed worker reply')` instead of crashing.

### L3-3. `pixels: ArrayBuffer` declared but `Uint8Array` posted - silent copy
- **Category:** perf bug
- **Issue:** L62-64 types `pixels: ArrayBuffer` but `web/lightbox/tiled-decode-worker.js:10` posts `out.pixels` (a `Uint8Array` view) with transfer of `out.pixels.buffer`. L86: `new Uint8Array(ab)` interprets the view as a length, copying contents. ~1 MB memcpy per tile. Comment at L80-83 lies about zero-copy (cite logic-004 + verified evidence).
- **Fix:** Either: (a) widen reply type to `pixels: ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array` and branch at receive - `ev.data.pixels instanceof Uint8Array ? ev.data.pixels : new Uint8Array(ev.data.pixels)`. (b) change worker to post `out.pixels.buffer` directly. (a) is safer - touches one file.

### L3-4. Container bytes structured-cloned per tile (no load/decode split)
- **Category:** perf
- **Issue:** L122 postMessage sends full `bytes` (multi-MB JXTC container) per tile. With 16 tiles x 4 workers, browser performs up to 64 structured clones of the same buffer. Code comment L117-121 acknowledges. SAB is the only zero-copy answer for fan-out and is out of scope per file.
- **Fix:** Protocol bump: `{type:'load', bytesId, bytes}` ONCE per worker (sent at pool.acquire time or first decode). Worker caches `Map<bytesId, Uint8Array>` (LRU, cap=4). Subsequent `{type:'decode', id, bytesId, region, format}` carries only ~24 bytes. Pool tracks `bytesId to workers warmed with it`. Worker pool gains a hot/cold acquire distinction.

### L3-5. No `cancel` message - in-flight worker tiles cannot be stopped
- **Category:** bug + missing feature
- **Issue:** Once worker has the request, it runs to completion. UI pan/zoom invalidates the viewport but worker keeps decoding the now-discarded tile. Caller-side reject is cosmetic.
- **Fix:** Protocol `{type:'cancel', id}`. Worker checks before posting reply (libjxl tile decode is non-interruptible mid-call per CLAUDE.md, so this is best-effort: skip the postMessage if cancelled, freeing main from receiving + memcpy). Pairs with L1-4 AbortSignal.

### L3-6. No worker readiness signal - prewarm cold-start invisible
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** L171-179 `prewarm()` synchronously creates workers and arms idle timer. Worker top-level `preloadJxlModule()` is async; first decode after prewarm still pays compile cost. Pool acquires the worker as if warm. (cite concurrency-014.)
- **Fix:** Worker posts `{type:'ready'}` once `preloadJxlModule()` resolves. `WorkerHandle` gains `ready: boolean`. Pool's `acquire()` skips not-ready handles (or returns a promise that resolves on ready). Idle-timer arms only after ready.

### L3-7. `onMessage` missing `settled` guard - late reply re-settles
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** L76-92 resolves/rejects without checking `settled`. `onError` (L94-99) does check. Asymmetric. Late message after error -> `cleanup()` runs twice + already-settled Promise gets a no-op resolve. Benign now, fragile if state expands.
- **Fix:** Add `if (settled) return;` at the top of `onMessage`. Hoist `settled` into closure (already is). One-line fix.

### L3-8. Poisoned worker stays in pool after silent fail
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** If a worker mis-reports (e.g., wrong-id reply, malformed shape) and `decodeTileWithWorker` rejects (after L3-2 fix), pool.release returns the handle to idle (L222 - only destroys if `terminated|bad`). Next caller gets the same bad worker.
- **Fix:** On reject in `decodeTileWithWorker`, mark handle as bad via callback into pool (`pool.markBad(worker)`). Or: `decodeTilesParallel` catches per-tile error and calls a pool-exposed `recycle(worker)` before the worker re-enters idle. Pool already has `recycle()` internal - promote to method or thread through error callback.

### L3-9. Worker error is opaque string - no taxonomy for recycle vs retry
- **Category:** feature
- **Issue:** L91 / L97 wrap `error: string` into `new Error(string)`. Caller cannot distinguish 'malformed bytes (worker is fine)' from 'OOM/crash (worker is poisoned)'. Caller in `decodeTilesParallel` (L349-355) bails out the whole slice regardless.
- **Fix:** Reply gains `error: { code: 'JXTC_PARSE'|'OOM'|'BAD_REGION'|'INTERNAL', message }`. Pool gets a `shouldRecycleOnCode(code)` policy. JXTC_PARSE -> caller bug, keep worker. OOM/INTERNAL -> recycle. BAD_REGION -> caller bug, keep worker.

### L3-10. Module-scope `nextWorkerId` not reset on dispose
- **Category:** bug (low)
- **Issue:** L66 monotonic across all pools. If pool is rebuilt (after L1-5 destroy/recreate), ids continue from the old counter. Late messages from the destroyed pool's workers - if not terminated yet - could collide with new-pool tile ids.
- **Fix:** Pool-instance counter: move `nextWorkerId` to `class PyramidWorkerPool` field, initialize 0 per instance. Combined with `destroy()` ensuring worker `terminate()` runs before new ids issued, late-message routing is impossible.

### L3-11. No reply timeout in protocol; only host-side timeout possible
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** Protocol gives the worker no deadline. Host-side timeout (per L1-4) rejects the Promise but the worker keeps churning, blocking pool slot until completion or termination. Cite concurrency-003.
- **Fix:** Include `deadlineMs?: number` in request. Worker tracks via `Date.now()` and self-aborts at next libjxl call boundary (best-effort, libjxl ROI decode is one call - so a timeout primarily benefits the cleanup case: worker observes deadline expired BEFORE running, replies `{ok:false, error:{code:'TIMEOUT'}}` instantly when host re-uses it).

### L3-12. FEATURE: progress / heartbeat for worker liveness
- **Category:** feature
- **Issue:** Pool has no liveness signal between request and reply. A worker stuck in libjxl (rare but possible - pathological JXTC) is indistinguishable from a worker doing legitimate slow work. Health monitor (concurrency-023) needs an input signal.
- **Fix:** Optional `{type:'progress', id, percent}` from worker at coarse intervals (e.g., post-decode-before-encode). Pool's monitor (introduced separately) marks workers silent for >N seconds as suspect. Low priority but unlocks adaptive timeouts.

# Lens 4 - Lifecycle + cancellation

Scope: `PyramidWorkerPool` class state machine (L141-302), module singleton (L304), `getOrCreatePool` (L306-321), `prewarm`/`acquire`/`release` (L171-230), `recycle`/`destroyHandle` (L252-301), and the end-to-end abort path (none currently exists).

### L4-1. `destroyed` flag never set true - all four guards are dead branches
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** L152 `private destroyed = false;`. Read at L172, 187, 222, 235, 307 but never assigned `true` anywhere in the class. `getOrCreatePool` uses `pool['destroyed']` (L307) to detect torn-down pools but the condition can never fire. Cite logic-006, contracts-015.
- **Fix:** Precondition for L4-2 destroy(). On its own: useless guard. Fix as part of the destroy() implementation.

### L4-2. No public `destroy()` / `dispose()` - singleton leaks across tests + HMR
- **Category:** bug + missing feature
- **Issue:** Module-scope `let pool: PyramidWorkerPool | null = null` (L304). No exported teardown. Test reload, gallery dismount, route change all leave the pool with active workers. Combined with L4-1, even attempting `pool['destroyed'] = true` does not terminate workers.
- **Fix:** Add `destroy(): Promise<void>` method: set destroyed=true, drain idle (call destroyHandle on each), abort active (per L4-3), wait for active set to drain or hard-terminate after grace period, then null the `handleByWorker` WeakMap entries. Export `disposePyramidWorkerPool()` that nulls the module singleton and awaits destroy().

### L4-3. No AbortSignal threading viewport-end-to-end
- **Category:** bug + missing feature
- **Issue:** `decodeTiledViewportPooled` options (L376) has no `signal?: AbortSignal`. Likewise `decodeTilesParallel`, `decodeTileWithWorker`. Pan/zoom invalidates the viewport but in-flight worker tiles keep running, holding pool slots, racing to deliver pixels the UI will discard. Cite concurrency-009, L1-4.
- **Fix:** Thread `signal: AbortSignal` through all three. `decodeTileWithWorker`: on `signal.aborted` reject immediately; on `abort` event during in-flight, call `worker.postMessage({type:'cancel', id})` (L3-5) and reject with `AbortError`. `decodeTilesParallel`: AbortController internal, aborted on first failure OR external signal -> sets `failed=true`. Pool slot released regardless.

### L4-4. `armIdleTimer` only arms just-released handle - older idles never reaped
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** L261-273: when a worker is released, the timer is armed for THAT handle only, and the `idle.length > minIdle` check is evaluated at arm time. Earlier-enqueued idle handles, released when count was <= minIdle, never get a reaper armed. They stay warm forever (which is fine), but they also do not get reaped when later releases push count above minIdle. Cite logic-005.
- **Fix:** Re-arm reaper for ALL idle handles above the floor when the floor is crossed. Or: track a single `excessReaperTimer` for the pool; cycle the oldest idle handle when fired. Simpler: on every release, scan `idle.slice(0, idle.length - minIdle)` and ensure each has a timer. With max=8, scan is trivially cheap.

### L4-5. `getOrCreatePool` binds first-seen workerFactory forever
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** L306-321: subsequent calls with a different `workerFactory` are silently ignored - the existing singleton is returned. Tests inject mock factories that the first production call already overrode; second gallery using a different worker URL gets the wrong worker. Cite logic-003, L1-5.
- **Fix:** Detect factory-identity change: store `boundFactory` on the pool instance; if `getOrCreatePool(factory)` sees a different factory function reference AND the pool has zero active decodes, transparently call `destroy()` and rebuild. If active > 0, throw `Error('cannot swap workerFactory while pool is busy')` so callers see the conflict.

### L4-6. Worker terminated mid-decode hangs the in-flight promise
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** `recycle(h)` (L252-259) calls `destroyHandle(h)` which calls `worker.terminate()` (L296). If a tile decode is in flight and the worker has its `error` listener fire (recycling itself) OR another caller's `destroy()` runs, the in-flight `decodeTileWithWorker` Promise never settles - the message listener is removed by cleanup() but the worker is gone before the message ever arrived. Cite concurrency-002.
- **Fix:** Track in-flight requests per handle: `WorkerHandle.inflight = Set<{id, reject}>`. On `destroyHandle`, before `terminate()`, reject every in-flight request with `Error('worker terminated during decode')`. Then `cleanup()` in decodeTileWithWorker is idempotent (already settled).

### L4-7. Permanent recycle listener accumulation on long-lived workers
- **Category:** bug (low)
- **Issue:** L242-248 adds `error` + `messageerror` listeners at spawn but never removes them. `destroyHandle` calls `terminate()` which is a hard kill - listeners drop with the worker. So per-worker accumulation is OK. BUT: if `bad=true` is set externally and the handle is recycled in-place (some future change), listeners stack. Cite concurrency-011.
- **Fix:** Store the bound `recycle` reference on the handle: `h.recycleListener = recycle`. On any path that detaches the worker without terminating (none exists today; would be needed if pool ever supports worker handoff), call `removeEventListener`. Defensive but cheap.

### L4-8. `minIdle` floor not maintained after `destroyHandle` drop
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** If a worker errors and `recycle` -> `destroyHandle` removes it, idle count may fall below `minIdle`. Pool does not respawn to restore the floor. Next acquire spawns under cap (good) but the warm guarantee was silently broken between events.
- **Fix:** After `destroyHandle`, if `!destroyed` and `idle.length < minIdle && all.size < maxSize`, spawn replacement and push to idle. Defer if spawn fails.

### L4-9. No supersede semantics - newer ROI does not preempt older same-level
- **Category:** missing feature
- **Issue:** Pan generates a stream of ROI requests for the same level. Older request is still in flight when newer arrives. Pool has no notion of 'cancel all in-flight requests for level X'. UI must wait for the stale decode + the new one.
- **Fix:** Optional: tag requests with a `streamId` (per-viewport). Pool exposes `cancelStream(streamId)` that aborts in-flight + drops queued for that id. Implementation rides on L4-3 AbortController per stream. Owner remains the caller (UI).

### L4-10. FEATURE: per-context pool instead of module singleton
- **Category:** feature
- **Issue:** Module-scope singleton (L304) means: one pool per realm. Multiple galleries on one page share workers tied to whichever loaded first. Worker URL drift across galleries (L4-5) and no scoping to per-tab Worker quotas.
- **Fix:** Expose `createPyramidWorkerPool(opts)` factory. Keep `getOrCreatePool` for backward-compat with default config. Galleries get isolated pools; tests get fresh pools; production keeps the convenience singleton.

### L4-11. No worker liveness timeout - health monitor input gap
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** Pool has no notion of 'worker has not replied in N seconds'. Combined with L3-11 (no protocol deadline), the stuck-worker case is invisible to the pool. Cite concurrency-023.
- **Fix:** Pool config: `requestTimeoutMs?: number`. On `decodeTileWithWorker` enter, schedule `setTimeout(timeout, ms)`; on settle, clearTimeout. On fire, reject + mark handle bad + recycle. Distinct from request-side `deadlineMs` (L3-11): this is pool's enforcement, that is worker's self-awareness.

### L4-12. `spawnOne` partial-failure orphans handle in `all` set
- **Category:** bug
- **Issue:** L234-249: handle is added to `this.all` (L238) and `this.handleByWorker` (L239) BEFORE the lifecycle listener wiring at L243-248. If `worker.factory()` succeeded but `addEventListener` throws (some test doubles fail here), the try/catch swallows it and the handle is in `all` with no recycle listener - it cannot self-heal on error. Cite concurrency-018.
- **Fix:** Register handle to `all`/`handleByWorker` AFTER lifecycle wiring succeeds. Move L238-239 to after L246. Or: on the addEventListener catch, `terminate()` the worker + skip the handle. Either is a 4-line change.

# Lens 5 - Error propagation

Scope: every throw, reject, catch, and silent fallback across the three files. Cross-cutting: error taxonomy + observability are zero.

### L5-1. `decodeWhole` leaks WASM decoder on push/close/drain throw
- **Category:** high bug
- **Issue:** decode-level.ts L20-45: `decoder.dispose()` at L42 only runs after L39-41 (`push`, `close`, drain) all succeed. Any throw skips dispose; the WASM heap stays allocated and the JS-side decoder reference is GC'd without releasing libjxl state. Cite errors-dl-dispose-leak.
- **Fix:** Wrap in try/finally: `try { await decoder.push(bytes); await decoder.close(); await drain; } finally { await decoder.dispose().catch(() => {}); }`. dispose is idempotent per existing decoder contract.

### L5-2. `decodeWhole` drain IIFE rejection becomes unhandled
- **Category:** high bug
- **Issue:** decode-level.ts L29-37: the `(async () => { for await ... })()` IIFE is started but not awaited until L41. If push() throws synchronously OR close() throws BEFORE drain settles, the drain promise rejects independently with no observer - browser logs `Unhandled Promise Rejection`. Cite errors-dl-drain-unhandled-rejection.
- **Fix:** Capture the drain promise once: `const drainPromise = (async () => {...})();`. After try/finally on push+close, ALWAYS await drainPromise inside a `.catch()` or `Promise.allSettled([drainPromise, ...])` to consume the rejection.

### L5-3. NaN region dimensions bypass empty-check + over-allocate
- **Category:** low bug + security adjacent
- **Issue:** decode-level.ts L100-105 (and pool L382-385): `Math.min/Math.max` propagate NaN. `rw <= 0` is false when rw is NaN (NaN comparisons return false). Code proceeds with NaN-sized viewport. `new Uint8Array(NaN * NaN * 4)` is `new Uint8Array(0)` per ECMA spec (NaN ToInteger -> 0) which then silently produces a zero-pixel result. Cite errors-dl-nan-region-bypasses-clamp.
- **Fix:** Guard region inputs at entry: `if (!Number.isFinite(region.x) || !Number.isFinite(region.y) || !Number.isFinite(region.w) || !Number.isFinite(region.h)) throw new Error('region values must be finite numbers');`. Single-line check at the top of decodeTiledViewport + decodeTiledViewportPooled.

### L5-4. `chooseLevelForTarget` silently accepts NaN/zero/negative target
- **Category:** low bug
- **Issue:** choose-level.ts L8-16: no validation of `targetLongEdge`. Negative or NaN -> `longEdge(l.w,l.h) >= targetLongEdge` is true for all l (or vacuously false for NaN); zero -> always picks smallest. Caller mis-passes a viewport metric and the picker silently delivers garbage. Cite errors-cl-divbyzero-zero-targetedge.
- **Fix:** `if (!Number.isFinite(targetLongEdge) || targetLongEdge <= 0) throw new RangeError('targetLongEdge must be a positive finite number');` at the top. Pair with L5-13 taxonomy if introduced.

### L5-5. `Promise.all` leaks in-flight tile decodes on first reject
- **Category:** high bug
- **Issue:** decode-level.ts L114-119: first rejecting tile aborts Promise.all but the other in-flight tile decodes continue racing to completion, consuming WASM heap until their final frame or dispose. No AbortSignal threading (cite L1-4, L4-3, concurrency-001).
- **Fix:** Replace Promise.all with the same coroutine pattern as pool's `decodeTilesParallel` (L323-364) and pre-wire AbortController. On first reject: signal.abort() -> subsequent iterations check signal.aborted before allocating + skip. Pairs with L4-3.

### L5-6. Four silent `catch {}` blocks in pool - failures invisible in prod
- **Category:** medium bug cluster
- **Issue:** tiled-decode-pool.ts L106-108, L114-116 (decodeTileWithWorker listener removal/attach), L246-248 (spawnOne listener attach), L209-211 (spawnOne factory call), L297-300 (terminate). All swallow without logging. Spawn-fail (logic-007, errors-tdp-spawn-fail-silent) is the most dangerous - pool silently degrades to fewer workers and caller hits the fallback path with no telemetry.
- **Fix:** Introduce a single `onError(scope: string, err: unknown)` hook on the pool, default = `console.warn`. Replace all 4 silent catches with `catch (e) { this.opts.onError?.('spawn-failed', e); }` etc. Caller can wire to Sentry / structured logger. Pairs with L5-12.

### L5-7. Worker error wraps a string - root cause discarded
- **Category:** medium bug
- **Issue:** tiled-decode-pool.ts L91: `reject(new Error(ev.data.error))`. The worker likely had a real Error with stack + name; serializing to string strips both. Caller's catch sees only the message; no programmatic discrimination possible. L97 has similar pattern (`ev?.message || ev || 'unknown'`).
- **Fix:** Worker should post `{ok:false, error:{code, message, stack?}}` (cite L3-9). Receiver constructs `Error` from message, attaches `code` + `cause`: `const err = new Error(ev.data.error.message); (err as any).code = ev.data.error.code; reject(err);`. Modern JS Error supports `cause` option: `new Error(msg, { cause: { code } })`.

### L5-8. `decodeTilesParallel` keeps only firstErr - others lost
- **Category:** low bug
- **Issue:** tiled-decode-pool.ts L335-355: `let firstErr: unknown = null;` records only the first failure. Other workers see `failed` flag and exit their slice without their errors propagating. If two workers fail near-simultaneously (e.g., cascading OOM), only one is reported.
- **Fix:** Aggregate via `AggregateError`: collect errors per-coroutine into `const errors: Error[] = []`. On Promise.all completion, if errors.length > 0 throw `new AggregateError(errors, 'tile decode failed')`. Match Node + modern browser API. Caller can inspect `.errors`.

### L5-9. `release()` in `finally` masks decode error
- **Category:** low bug
- **Issue:** tiled-decode-pool.ts L420-425: `try { ... await decodeTilesParallel(...); return stitch(...); } finally { p.release(liveWorkers); }`. If release() throws (synchronous mutation on this.idle/this.active - normally cannot, but could after future destroyed mutation), the thrown release error replaces the in-flight decode error. Cite errors-tdp-finally-release-mask-error.
- **Fix:** Wrap release in try/catch and surface via onError hook (L5-6): `} finally { try { p.release(liveWorkers); } catch (e) { p.opts.onError?.('release-failed', e); } }`. Decode error propagates cleanly.

### L5-10. Generic Error everywhere - no taxonomy
- **Category:** info opportunity (cross-file)
- **Issue:** Across all three files, every throw is `new Error(string)`. Callers cannot distinguish 'budget exceeded' from 'malformed bytes' from 'pool destroyed' from 'AbortError'. UI cannot decide retry vs surface vs ignore. Cite errors-opp-no-error-taxonomy.
- **Fix:** Introduce a tiny `errors.ts` with `class PyramidError extends Error { constructor(code: PyramidErrorCode, msg: string, cause?: unknown) { ... } }` + `type PyramidErrorCode = 'EMPTY_REGION'|'BAD_REGION'|'NO_FINAL_FRAME'|'WORKER_FAILED'|'POOL_DESTROYED'|'ABORTED'`. Replace all `new Error(...)` with `new PyramidError(code, msg)`. Caller switches on `err instanceof PyramidError && err.code === ...`.

### L5-11. Zero logging - pool degradation invisible
- **Category:** info opportunity
- **Issue:** tiled-decode-pool.ts has no `console.*` or logger anywhere. Spawn failure, factory rebind ignore, listener-attach failure, terminate failure all silent. In a customer report `pyramid feels slow' there is no trace evidence to triage. Cite errors-opp-no-structured-logging.
- **Fix:** Inject a logger interface at pool construction: `opts.logger?: { warn(msg, ctx), info(msg, ctx) }`. Default = no-op (no console noise). Wire to events: spawn-failed, recycled, prewarm-completed, fallback-to-single. Production wires to structured logger; tests assert on calls.

### L5-12. No retry on transient worker failures
- **Category:** info opportunity
- **Issue:** First tile failure aborts the whole viewport decode (L5-8). Some failures (transient WASM heap fragmentation, momentary OOM at large tile) succeed on retry with a fresh worker. Cite errors-opp-no-retry-utility.
- **Fix:** After L5-7 error taxonomy: `decodeTilesParallel` could re-queue tiles whose error code is `RETRYABLE` (OOM, INTERNAL) onto a fresh worker, up to N attempts per tile. Stop on `BAD_REGION` or `JXTC_PARSE` (caller-cause errors don't retry). Caller opt-in via `opts.retryPolicy?: {maxAttempts}`. Conservative default = no retry.

### L5-13. Asymmetric region contract in `decodeLevel`
- **Category:** low bug
- **Issue:** decode-level.ts L130-137: `kind='whole'` + region -> throw `'region decode requires a tiled level source'`. `kind='tiled'` + no region -> silently defaults to `{x:0, y:0, w:source.width, h:source.height}`. The two kinds have opposite tolerances for the same argument absence/presence. Cite contracts-013.
- **Fix:** Symmetrize: `kind='whole'` + region -> ignore region (default to full image, log via L5-11 logger) OR throw both directions. Picking one: if region is undefined OR full-image, accept; if a strict sub-region with kind=whole, throw. Document in JSDoc.
