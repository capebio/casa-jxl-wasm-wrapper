/**
 * Synchronous cache filename. No crypto, no await.
 *
 * Was `async` over `crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', …)`: native C++, but ASYNC,
 * which infected every persistent call site (get/set/delete/remove) with an
 * await and a per-key digest. You don't need crypto strength to *name* a cache
 * file. A synchronous two-lane FNV-1a (64-bit) removes the async infection and is
 * ~98.7% faster on the hashing itself (flipflop: `cache-name-hash`, 286ms→3.4ms
 * over 4096 keys). Pushing it into WASM was measured and is *slower* (the boundary
 * copy beats the cheap hash — flipflop: `cache-hash-wasm`, +37–52%), so it stays
 * in JS as Doc 5 prescribed.
 *
 * The two namespaces are prefixed (`raw-` / `hash-`) so a short user key of the
 * literal form `hash-<hex>` can never collide with a hashed long key (handoff A5 / B7).
