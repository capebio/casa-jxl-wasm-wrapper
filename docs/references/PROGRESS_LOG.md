## Feature: Patches & Advanced Frame Settings Escape Hatch (advancedFrameSettings + JxlFrameSetting) - 2026-06

**Branch:** worktree (transpose-wasm-to-tauri) + main
**Status:** Core escape hatch implemented (WASM + native parity)

**WASM Changes:**
- `packages/jxl-wasm/src/facade.ts` — added `advancedFrameSettings?: Array<{id,value}>` + `JxlFrameSetting` named constants helper (PATCHES=8). Wired in streaming input (`enc_create_image_adv`) and buffered metadata path using `_adv` FFI variants.
- `packages/jxl-wasm/src/bridge.cpp` — added `ApplyAdvancedFrameSettings` helper + storage in `JxlWasmEncState`. Extended `EncodeRgbaWithMetadata`, `enc_create_image`/`enc_finish`, and exported `_adv` functions. Temporary WASM allocations for ids/values with proper free.

**Native (Tauri) Changes:**
- `packages/jxl-native/src/index.ts` — matching `advancedFrameSettings` field + `JxlFrameSetting` constants.
- `packages/jxl-native/src/native.cc` — extended `EncoderData`, parsing in `CreateEncoder`, application of `SetOption` calls.

**Benchmark Wiring:**
- `web/jxl-wrapper-lab.html` + `.js` — minimal experimental checkbox "Enable Patches (experimental)" with strong content-dependent warning. Wired into `makeEncoderOptions()` using the escape hatch.

**Tests:**
- `packages/jxl-wasm/test/facade.test.ts` — smoke test for API acceptance + synthetic repeating content size-impact smoke test (with console logging).

**Docs Updated:**
- `docs/references/designs/patches-splines.md` — checklist updated.
- `docs/references/PROGRESS_LOG.md` — this entry.

**References Used:**
- `docs/references/designs/patches-splines.md`
- libjxl `encode.h` (JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_PATCHES = 8)

## Feature: Decoding Speed Tier (JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_DECODING_SPEED) - 2026-05-28

**Branch:** epiccodereview/20260527T054853
**Status:** Implemented in source

**WASM Changes:**
- `packages/jxl-wasm/src/facade.ts` — added `decodingSpeed?: number` to `EncoderOptions`, clamped to 0–4 in `resolveEncoderBridgeSettings` (omitted → -1 = no hint), forwarded through all `_x` encode call sites.
- `packages/jxl-wasm/src/bridge.cpp` — added `enc_decoding_speed` to `JxlWasmEncState`; applies `JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_DECODING_SPEED` when value ≥ 0; extended all `_x` exported functions and `jxl_wasm_enc_create_image_x`.

**Benchmark Wiring:**
- `web/jxl-wrapper-lab.html` — added Decode speed tier spinpicker (0–4, default 0).
- `web/jxl-wrapper-lab.js` — `getDecodeSpeed()` helper; wired into `makeEncoderOptions()` and `syncSettingLabels`.

**Tauri/Native Changes (2026-05-29):**
- `packages/jxl-native/src/index.ts` — added `decodingSpeed?: number` to `EncoderOptions`.
- `packages/jxl-native/src/native.cc` — added `decoding_speed` field to `EncoderData`; parses `decodingSpeed` from JS options (clamped -1/0–4); applies `JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_DECODING_SPEED` in encoder setup.

**Tests:**
- `packages/jxl-wasm/test/facade.test.ts` — added `describe("decodingSpeed encoder option", ...)` with 5 tests covering tier forwarding, -1 default, clamp-to-0, clamp-to-4.
- `bun test packages/jxl-wasm/test/facade.test.ts` — 38 pass, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure.

**Docs Updated:**
- `docs/references/PROGRESS_LOG.md`

**References Used:**
- `docs/references/designs/decoding-speed-tier.md`

**Cleanup & Handoff:**
- Current state: Full implementation complete (WASM + native). WASM/browser runtime needs regenerated artifacts before browser can exercise the new C++ exports.
- Background processes / logs: None started intentionally.

## Feature: Photon Noise (JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_PHOTON_NOISE) - 2026-05-28

**Branch:** current workspace
**Status:** Implemented in source

**WASM Changes:**
- `packages/jxl-wasm/src/facade.ts` — added `photonNoiseIso?: number`, normalized omitted values to `0`, and forwarded it through extended `_x` encode paths.
- `packages/jxl-wasm/src/bridge.cpp` — applies `JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_PHOTON_NOISE` when ISO is greater than zero.

**Tauri Changes:**
- `packages/jxl-native/src/index.ts` — added `photonNoiseIso?: number`.
- `packages/jxl-native/src/native.cc` — parses `photonNoiseIso` and applies `JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_PHOTON_NOISE`.

**Benchmark Wiring:**
- `web/jxl-wrapper-lab.html` / `web/jxl-wrapper-lab.js` — added Photon noise ISO control and forwards it into wrapper encode options.

**Tests:**
- `packages/jxl-wasm/test/facade.test.ts` — added forwarding/source tests for photon noise.
- `npm --workspace packages/jxl-wasm run typecheck` passes.
- `npm --workspace packages/jxl-native run typecheck` passes.

**Docs Updated:**
- `docs/references/PROGRESS_LOG.md`
- `docs/references/designs/photon-noise.md`

**References Used:**
- `docs/references/designs/photon-noise.md`

**Cleanup & Handoff:**
- Current state: Source implementation complete. WASM/browser runtime needs regenerated artifacts before browser can exercise the new C++ exports.
- Background processes / logs: None started intentionally.
- Next session instructions: Rebuild WASM artifacts, then run the wrapper lab with ISO presets 0/800/1600/3200/6400.
- Handoff document (if any): none.

## Feature: Brotli Effort (JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_BROTLI_EFFORT) - 2026-05-28

## Feature: Brotli Effort (JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_BROTLI_EFFORT) - 2026-05-28

**Branch:** epiccodereview/20260527T054853  
**Status:** Completed

**WASM Changes:**
- `packages/jxl-wasm/src/bridge.cpp:334` — `JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_BROTLI_EFFORT` applied when `brotli_effort >= 0` (was already present)
- `packages/jxl-wasm/src/facade.ts` — `brotliEffort?: number` in `EncoderOptions`; clamped to -1..11; forwarded through all `_x` encode variants (was already present)

**Native Addon Changes (jxl-native, Node native addon — the "Tauri path" per design doc):**
- `packages/jxl-native/src/native.cc` — Added `int32_t brotli_effort = -1` to `EncoderData`; `CreateEncoder` reads + clamps `brotliEffort` option; `EncodeAll` applies `JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_BROTLI_EFFORT` when `>= 0`
- `packages/jxl-native/src/index.ts` — Added `brotliEffort?: number` to `EncoderOptions` interface
- Addon rebuilt successfully via `npx node-gyp rebuild`

**Benchmark Wiring:**
- `web/jxl-benchmark.js` — `#brotli-effort` control already wired (load/save, caption display)
- `benchmark/encode-option-sweep.mjs` — sweep across `[-1, 0, 4, 9, 11]` already present

**Tests:**
- `packages/jxl-native/test/codec.test.ts` — New test exercises `brotliEffort` at 0/9/11; all 2 tests pass

**Docs Updated:**
- `docs/references/designs/brotli-effort.md` — Status updated to Implemented; checklist items ticked
- `_cleanup.md` — Updated with native addon completion

**References Used:**
- `docs/references/designs/brotli-effort.md` (design note)
- `bridge.cpp` pattern (gold standard for `_x` function shape)

**Cleanup & Handoff:**
- Current state: Feature complete on both WASM and native addon sides. WASM `_x` bridge functions still require Emscripten rebuild to activate in browser.
- Background processes / logs: None active.
- Next session instructions: Rebuild WASM via `cmd /c "call C:\Users\User\emsdk\emsdk_env.bat >nul && node packages/jxl-wasm/scripts/build.mjs --host-toolchain"` then run `benchmark/encode-option-sweep.mjs` to validate size deltas.
- Handoff document: `_cleanup.md`

## Feature: Resampling Controls - 2026-05-28

**Branch:** current workspace
**Status:** Completed pending full WASM/native binary rebuild
**WASM Changes:**
- Added `EncoderOptions.resampling?: 1 | 2 | 4 | 8`.
- Forwarded normalized resampling through one-shot, metadata, sidecar, streaming, and streaming-input encode paths.
- Applied `JXL_ENC_FRAME_SETTING_RESAMPLING` in the C++ bridge when factor is 2/4/8.

**Native Changes:**
- Added `resampling?: 1 | 2 | 4 | 8` to native encoder options.
- Parsed and normalized the option in the N-API addon and applied the libjxl frame setting.

**Benchmark Wiring:**
- Added wrapper-lab 1x/2x/4x/8x resampling chips and forwarded the selected factor into wrapper/session encode options.

**Tests:**
- Added facade unit tests for forwarding `resampling: 4` and normalizing invalid values to 1.
- Verified targeted resampling tests and package typechecks.
- Full WASM build blocked because Docker daemon is unreachable from this environment.
- Native addon rebuild blocked because workspace-local `node-gyp` is missing.

**Docs Updated:**
- `docs/Overview and features of the CasaWASM JXL wrapper.md`

**References Used:**
- `docs/references/designs/resampling.md`

**Cleanup & Handoff:**
- Current state: Source and emitted TypeScript dist updated; binary WASM/native artifacts need rebuild in an environment with Docker/native build deps available.
- Background processes / logs: None active.
- Next session instructions: Start Docker Desktop/Linux engine, ensure `packages/jxl-native` dependencies are installed, then rerun `npm --workspace packages/jxl-wasm run build` and `npm --workspace packages/jxl-native run build`.
- Handoff document: `_cleanup.md`

## Feature: Metadata Boxes & Container Decisions - 2026-05-28

**Branch:** `epiccodereview/20260527T054853`
**Status:** Completed (WASM source + types + tests + benchmark wiring done; binary artifacts need rebuild)

**WASM Changes:**
- Added `WasmBoxOpts` (20-byte) and `WasmCustomBox` (16-byte) packed structs to `bridge.cpp`.
- Added `ApplyContainerMode()` and `AddCustomBoxes()` static helpers.
- Extended `EncodeRgbaWithMetadata` and `EncodeRgbaWithExtraChannels` with optional `box_opts` parameter; Brotli compress flag now sourced from `box_opts->compress_boxes`; added error codes 54/55 (standard) and 134/135 (extra-channel).
- New exported functions: `jxl_wasm_encode_rgba8_with_metadata_v2`, `jxl_wasm_encode_rgba8_with_metadata_ec_v2`, `jxl_wasm_transcode_jpeg_to_jxl_v2` (JPEG lossless transcode + EXIF/XMP + container control).
- Added `MetadataOptions` and `MetadataBoxSpec` interfaces to `facade.ts`; added `metadata?` and `customBoxes?` to `EncoderOptions`.
- Added `metadataBoxesV2` capability flag; capability-gated routing to v2 bridge functions.
- Added `resolveEffectiveMetadata`, `needsBoxOptsV2`, `marshalBoxOpts` helpers in `facade.ts`.

**Native Changes:**
- Added `icc_profile`, `exif`, `xmp` buffer fields and `compress_boxes`, `force_container`, `raw_codestream` booleans to `EncoderData` struct in `native.cc`.
- Added `GetNullableBufferProp()` NAPI helper to read nullable `ArrayBuffer` or Node `Buffer` properties.
- Wired `JxlEncoderUseContainer`, `JxlEncoderSetICCProfile`, and EXIF/XMP `JxlEncoderAddBox` calls in `EncodeAll`.
- Parsed `metadata` sub-object (compressBoxes/forceContainer/rawCodestream/includeICC/includeExif/includeXMP) in `CreateEncoder`.
- Added `MetadataOptions` and `MetadataBoxSpec` interfaces and extended `EncoderOptions` in `packages/jxl-native/src/index.ts` (customBoxes noted as not yet wired in native binding).

**Benchmark Wiring:**
- Added Compress boxes, Force container, and Raw codestream toggle controls to `web/jxl-wrapper-lab.html`.
- Added `getCompressBoxes()`, `getForceContainer()`, `getRawCodestream()` getters and wired them into `makeEncoderOptions()` as `metadata: { compressBoxes, forceContainer, rawCodestream }` in `web/jxl-wrapper-lab.js`.

**Tests:**
- Added 6 unit tests in `packages/jxl-wasm/test/facade.test.ts` covering: `includeExif:false` stripping, `compressBoxes`/`rawCodestream`/`forceContainer` WasmBoxOpts fields, custom box marshaling, and `rawCodestream` overriding `forceContainer`.
- Result: 44 pass, 1 pre-existing unrelated failure (`detectTier > returns scalar in Node/Bun`).

**Docs Updated:**
- `docs/references/designs/DESIGNS_INDEX.md` — status updated to "Implemented on branch `epiccodereview/20260527T054853`".

## 2026-05-29 — Extra Channel Distance (Phase 1)

**Feature:** Per-extra-channel distance + basic extra channel infrastructure
**Branch:** `epiccodereview/20260527T054853`
**Status:** Implemented

### What was done

- Fixed parameter-drop bug: `decodingSpeed`, `photonNoiseIso`, `resampling` were computed but not forwarded through the EC bridge path. Updated `EncodeRgbaWithExtraChannels`, both `_ec` and `_ec_v2` public bridge functions, facade TS declarations, and dispatch calls.
- Fixed inline resampling normalization to call `NormalizeResampling()` helper (consistent with all other encode paths).
- Added `_jxl_wasm_encode_rgba8_with_metadata_ec_v2` to `exports.txt` (was implemented but not exported).
- Added 5 unit tests (arg dispatch, alphaDistance arg index, extraChannels numEc, WasmExtraChannel descriptor layout, fallback path) + 1 integration test (lossless-alpha smoke test).

### Design note checklist status

- [x] Branch created
- [x] Declaration + distance setting in bridge
- [x] Alpha convenience path wired
- [x] Tests (dispatch, descriptor layout, lossless-alpha integration)
- [ ] Benchmark/lab page — deferred to Phase 2
- [ ] Tauri side — deferred
- [ ] Full handoff — see Phase 2 note (`extra-channel-infrastructure.md`)

### Commits

- fix(jxl-wasm): export _jxl_wasm_encode_rgba8_with_metadata_ec_v2
- fix(jxl-wasm): thread decodingSpeed/photonNoiseIso/resampling through EC bridge
- fix(jxl-wasm): use NormalizeResampling helper in EC encode path
- fix(jxl-wasm): pass decodingSpeed/photonNoiseIso/resampling in EC encode dispatch
- test(jxl-wasm): add extra-channel distance dispatch and descriptor tests
- test(jxl-wasm): assert alphaDistance sentinel -1 when no alphaDistance option
