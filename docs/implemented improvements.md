# Registry of Implemented Improvements & Optimizations

This document provides a systematic audit and running tally of the optimization and handoff documents located in the `docs` and root directories. It tracks which specifications have been fully integrated, which are checked in git, and which files still require optimization.

## Executive Summary

Based on an exhaustive audit of the codebase, git history, and latest working tree changes, we have verified that:
1. **The `jxl-policy` package is now FULLY IMPLEMENTED (`DONE`):** The user has recently implemented the outstanding changes from `JxlPolicyIndexDecisionsState - DONE.md` in `packages/jxl-policy/src/index.ts`! The preset tables (`decodePolicies`/`encodePolicies`) are now frozen, type derivation via index access is complete, runtime policy validation has been added, and the `downsampleForContainer` utility as well as the `mlInference` preset are fully coded.
2. **Most Core Pipeline Handoffs and Code Reviews are Fully Implemented:** Standard browser/node pipeline optimizations, stream range fetching, worker loader/spawners, native-codec bindings, scheduler queues/budgets, progressive saliency, and most notably, the massive **Epic Code Reviews** on both the Rust WASM metadata pipeline and the `jxl-pyramid` decode trio are fully implemented and checked in.
3. **Key Tooling and Scripts are Completed, while Core Optimization Clusters Remain Outstanding:**
   - **Preflight & Script Robustness (`HANDOFF-jxl-capabilities-index-probe-wb-probe-lens-review - DONE.md`):** Fully completed! `probe.ts` has received full preflight connection checks and fallback launching options, and `wb-probe.ts` has been refactored to use named constants for its 15 parameters with automated PowerShell wildcard directory expansion and exit status reporting.
   - **Advanced Browser Decoder & Facade Optimizations (`HANDOFF-worker-decode-handler-facade-lens-review.md`):** Partially implemented. Only `worker.ts` has received the lifecycle safety additions (aborted starts and serialization listeners). The major browser performance optimizations (such as `R14-F1` removing full-frame copies on region decodes and `R14-D1` ending worker decodes early on progressive targets) have **not** been implemented.
   - **Tauri Native Region/ROI Decode:** Tiled ROI / JXTC region decode is pending native implementation.

## Detailed Outstanding Work (What files have NOT been optimized yet?)

This section compiles the specific files and folders that have been missed or are partially implemented:

### 1. Browser Decoder & Facade Optimizations (R14-D and R14-F)
* **Document Ref:** `docs/HANDOFF-worker-decode-handler-facade-lens-review.md`
* **Status:** Partially Implemented (only `worker.ts` has abortedStarts/messageerror additions).
* **Missing Work in `decode-handler.ts` (browser):**
  - **R14-D1:** Early progression targets (`"dc" | "pass"`) do not terminate worker slots early; sessions remain active and locked inside `decodeSessions` until manually released by the main thread.
  - **R14-D2:** Pause signals are not checked between chunks during active inner feed-loops (can cause the worker to continue decoding during active scheduler pauses).
  - **R14-D4:** Skip `decode_cancelled` emissions for `release_state` actions to avoid dead structured-clone roundtrips.
* **Missing Work in `facade.ts` (WASM):**
  - **R14-F1 (Critical Perf Win):** Fuse buffer views and crop/downsample/resize directly to avoid allocating and copying a full-frame pixel slice. This causes massive memory bandwidth and GC overhead on high-res gallery and viewer renders.
  - **R14-F5:** Dedupe FFI field reads; extract a helper `readBufferFields(module, handle)` instead of duplicated HEAPU32 offsets.
  - **R14-F7:** Butteraugli compare uploads both images on every call; needs resident reference caching to half the FFI transfer costs during convergence sweeps.
  - **R14-F12:** Fuse cover-mode resize + crop: avoid resizing pixel lines that get cropped out immediately.

### 2. Native Parity decode_region (Tauri)
* **Document Ref:** `docs/HANDOFF-tauri-parity-2026-06-03.md`
* **Status:** Partially Implemented.
* **Missing Work in `crates/raw-pipeline/src/jxl_lowlevel.rs`:**
  - Plumb tiled ROI decoding down to native structures.
  - Pass the normalized subject rect down to native codecs to crop inside the low-level decoder instead of full-decode-then-crop.
